I met Daniel K. on a plane coming home from Dublin. We work in the
same place. We had conversations from the very start that almost
redefined what conversation means. What we've hit on together is
that our problems are sometimes perplexing, but that they are
the royal road to understanding.

We both venerate nature, having been transformed by her at times.
Daniel is a good artist, and he's inspired me to draw. He's
interested in a more technical/coding path, and I've shared
what little I know from 20 years in that style of work.

We are very much privileged Western people of course, and we know
it. We try to see the bubbles we live in. We try to feel our way
to the life we want.

So...one day Daniel suggested we should record our conversations.
Before I let myself think about it too much, I agreed and bought
a voice recorder. This podcast is a result of that unseemly rush
into over-sharing that should be better passed up by most of you,
but I hope one or two people like it. If you do, send us a mail
and let's get together!
