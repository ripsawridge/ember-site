                <p>This site is primarily devoted to my {{#link-to "sections.trips"}}longtime hobby{{/link-to}} of alpine climbing.
                    I learned to climb in Washington State, and moved to Munich in 2006 to explore the Alps. I enjoy the
                    mountain activities so much that Iâ€™ve obsessively recorded them since the very first climb in 1997.

                <p>Occasionally I write on my blog about music, metaphysics, politics, books, or family strolls through the
                    Englischer Garten.</p>
