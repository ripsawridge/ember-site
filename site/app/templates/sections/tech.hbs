                I've worked on the Chrome V8 team since 2012, first on the Runtime, and especially
                arrays. Later I started the move away from patching ICs to "vector ICs," which
                store map-based feedback in simple arrays instead of compiled code. Now I manage
                the Javascript Execution Optimization Team, and sneak in a little bit of
                programming now and then.
            </p>

                Though it saddens me a bit, because I started out programming as a hobby, once I
                started working all day on computers, I wanted to spend my time at home another way --
                hence this web site and it's historical orientation towards climbing. I seem to have
                more room to program at home now though, so more might show up here. I'm
                happy to work on an open source product...it lets me talk about what I'm doing,
                which I love to do.
