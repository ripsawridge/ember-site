Barbara was skeptical, but I insisted on using the lift to\nget as much climbing as we possibly could!</p>\n<p>We hiked over to climb the Bergführer Route on the Torre Grande West Summit (IV+).\nBut there were several people waiting, and it seemed hard/scary. We decided to\ndo something else first.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28987009852'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8148/28987009852_17afc71db0_b.jpg'></a>\nIn a Hexenstein chimney</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473814893'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8504/28473814893_31d8cda1ef_b.jpg'></a>\nTime for pizza</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29015134041'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8023/29015134041_37fe1f9368_b.jpg'></a>\nYes, this really happened</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28805629080'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8406/28805629080_138721e945_b.jpg'></a>\nG&#39;schafft!</p>\n<p>We hiked over to Torre Latina, to climb the Normal Route (III+). It was\nthree easy pitches.</p>\n<p>This went great! We enjoyed the easy climbing. Being a cool dude, I think I wore\ntennis shoes. On top, we met a nice couple from Saxony. The man was bedecked with\na bunch of slings with knots in them. That was his protection rack. Much cheaper than\nall my expensive gear!</p>\n<p>We abseiled from the other side of the mountain, making two rappels. Barbara had\na funny exchange with the woman...she wasn&#39;t really sure how safe things were, and\nafter asking a lot of questions felt better.</p>\n<p>This couple told us that we should climb the Ostkamin (East Chimney), rated IV, which\nwas just around the other side of the peak. It offered two fun pitches. Barbara\nbelayed me up the first pitch, which I did according to the advice of the nice fella.\nHe suggested following an easier line coming in from the right and trending left.\nI found it to be loose but doable. The second pitch was more adventurous, climbing\na vertical chimney to the summit. I ended up going the wrong way and having to climb\nback down some distance. When Barbara came up, she was kinda freaked out from the\ndeep exposure. She looked down between her legs and decided that had been a mistake!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29059251366'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8594/29059251366_9be09704fb_b.jpg'></a>\nOn our first summit</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473817843'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8524/28473817843_380a36d5af_b.jpg'></a>\nWe ate at Croda Cafe every night</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473838023'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8092/28473838023_4aaa62a157_b.jpg'></a>\nShe is fun</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29091946715'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7590/29091946715_7c503e2aff_b.jpg'></a>\nA rack of knots</p>\n<p>Her last moves to the summit were marked by considerable tension! She was very happy\nto finish the pitch. It wasn&#39;t long however, before she was obsessing over how unreasonably\nit had scared her. This led to a determination to always look down...practicing her\nability to tolerate steep terrain and constantly improving it.</p>\n<p>We made another rappel and used the early evening hours to climb an old favorite...a\nroute I&#39;d climbed with Fred Beckey a few years before - the Normal Route on\nTorre Quarta Bassa (IV-). It&#39;s three wonderful pitches. Barbara enjoyed this one very\nmuch. We had to rappel down the backside.</p>\n<p>We went down to our apartment in Cortina and began a tradition of eating pizza every night\nat the Croda Cafe. It was wonderful!</p>\n<h2 id=\"friday\">Friday</h2>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29015206771'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8633/29015206771_4971063a47_b.jpg'></a>\nFree of the crowds</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28805616890'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8483/28805616890_5c30cf10ae_b.jpg'></a>\nThe scary spot</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28987073332'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8072/28987073332_6efe91a9f0_b.jpg'></a>\n&quot;How do we get down, now?&quot;</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29059300946'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8102/29059300946_10448bea30_b.jpg'></a>\nThis was a long pitch.</p>\n<p>I let us sleep in. A girl has to be gently lowered into this world, and 5 am starts\naren&#39;t the best way to do that! We got some coffee at the little shop below our apartment,\nbought a few apples for snacks, and were underneath the Hexenstein at about 11:30.\nWe were climbing the classic and popular Südkante (IV), which has 8 wonderful pitches.\nI&#39;d done the route twice before, once with Dan Protz and once with Aidan. Super fun\nmemories. We hiked up to the base and waited for several parties to get started and move\na bit up the route. I think we were climbing around 1 pm. Pitch 4 had some strange moves,\nand I was worried that Barbara would have a hard time following them (so was she). But\nshe did fine, climbing up a chimney with just a few good holds. Later, there was a \ntraverse into a deep chimney that was intimidating. And just after some easy ground on\npitch 6, she slipped unexpectedly. Everything was fine, but it reminded her to be\ncareful.</p>\n<p>We avoided the crux crack below the summit for easier terrain on the left - Barbara\nhad done fantastic and we didn&#39;t need something hard!</p>\n<p>On the summit we signed the logbook, which would prove to be helpful later.</p>\n<p>Barbara had left two cams on the route somehow, an Alien and a Camelot #2. I didn&#39;t even\nnotice, because I was placing very little gear. As our trip ended, I realized I&#39;d lost the\ngear. And then Barbara got a message on Facebook saying someone had the cams! Fantastic!\nIn time they were mailed to us from some new friends in the north of Germany. They&#39;d climbed\nbehind us on the route, and found us by photographing our names in the summit log book, \nthen looking on Facebook and finding Barbara. Amazing.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29015182331'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8513/29015182331_afed8a6299_b.jpg'></a>\nSitting with Barbara</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473846843'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8861/28473846843_50bb8743a0_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Falzarego Pass</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29091962685'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8311/29091962685_80048b0874_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the Hexenstein</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28805611530'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8396/28805611530_e9febc5d47_b.jpg'></a>\nHere we go</p>\n<p>We really enjoyed the walk down through trenches from the first world war. Again, pizza\nat Cafe Croda. Barbara was so happy and amazed to discover this kind of life. I was so\nhappy to share it with her.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saturday\">Saturday</h2>\n<p>The weather would be sunny and nice on Saturday, and I was determined to get in a full\nclimbing day. But I couldn&#39;t wake my sleeping angel. Finally, around 10:30 am, we were \nhiking up to the\nNordwestkante on the Kleiner Falzaregoturm (IV-), which gave four fun pitches of climbing\nin a beautifully exposed location. Barbara found the climbing pretty easy, but she enjoyed\nthe sun and the rock. There is a picture of her sitting on the summit and just feeling\nthe magical mountain air.</p>\n<p>We made a steep 25 meter rappel from the summit, then descended travelling in coils back\nto the base in a chimney and gully system.</p>\n<p>At about 3 o&#39;clock, we were ready to climb the West Face of the Großer Falzaregoturm (IV).\nFive fantastic pitches got us to the top, where we found a beautiful patch of Edelweiß.\nThe first pitch was the most exciting, with steep and solid IV moves. Barbara was\nreally getting some good mileage on the rock. On the summit, we were going to share a\ndouble rope rappel with an Italian couple. But I became dubious of the need for a double\nrope rappel. Instead, Barbara and I descended a marked scrambling route, finally\nmaking a few single rope rappels lower in the gully while the Italian couple dealt\nwith their impossibly twisted double ropes. Barbara loved descending in coils of rope.\nShe likes the excitement of &quot;finding your own way,&quot; and fully understands that the\nterrain requires concentration and care. She likes the improvised protection, found\nwhen necessary.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473874213'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8707/28473874213_cea24a175a_b.jpg'></a>\nInteresting descent</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/28473849263'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8479/28473849263_4b612af5bf_b.jpg'></a>\nComing down the back side</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29015145891'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8324/29015145891_be505d6c9a_b.jpg'></a>\nCold summer day</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/29059346986'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8679/29059346986_54e60b63b4_b.jpg'></a>\nGoing home</p>\n<p>Really amazing, to me, and fun, to experience this with her.</p>\n<p>We like our traditions, and I&#39;m pretty sure we ended the night with another trip\nto Cafe Croda, our last delicious pizza in Cortina!</p>\n<h2 id=\"sunday\">Sunday</h2>\n<p>On the last day, we went and climbed the Ostkamin again on Torre Lusy.\nBarbara had been practicing &quot;looking down,&quot; and was ready for the scary last pitch\nagain. This time, she did it with more control. It was still a bit creepy. The thing\nis, you can see your packs and shoes down beneath your feet, 60 meters directly below.\nAnd the chimney feels kind of wild, rotten and steep. After this, we thought we&#39;d try\nthe Bergführer Route again. But I went up one pitch and decided that it was too much\nfor us this trip. I climbed back down, happy to save this route for next time.</p>\n<p>Barbara and I hiked over to Nuvolau, had some drinks on top, then hiked back to the car\nand drove home. What an amazing trip.</p>\n"}
