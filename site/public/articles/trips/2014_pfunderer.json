The weather wasn&#39;t amazing, but\nwe brought umbrellas and resolved to make the best of it. I found a four or five\nday hike in the Pfunderer Berge, which is the southern side of the Zillertal\nRange. This is in Italy, sometimes hard against the Austrian border. We drove\nthrough rainy mountains, went shopping for snacks at the last decent sized town\nwhich was called Mühlen in Taufers, then made the short drive from there to\nLappach. I was worried about parking, but we managed okay. The town was building\na new tunnel which appeared to be very oversized next to the small array of\nhouses and churches. It rained lightly.</p>\n<p>We had a lot of ground to cover, and headed up a very steep trail behind the\ntown to a narrow grassy pass 1000 meters above the town called the\nLappacherjöchl. Along the way, a month got on Elijah&#39;s hat, and he rode all the\nway from deep forest to high meadows above timberline.</p>\n<p>We ate some wild strawberries, and I even nibbled on a fine looking mushroom\ngrowing nearby. No ill effects to report!</p>\n<p>The boys did a great job on this sometimes punishing section in the forest, and\nthey loved playing in the boulders by a little house at mid-height, just before\nwalking a road for a little while to grassy country below the pass.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644545137'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3842/14644545137_16cd334b36_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the way to the Tristan Lake</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14850941333'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3837/14850941333_d4cd272177_b.jpg'></a>\nThis river was extremely white!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14808209846'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2926/14808209846_0d06a247ec_b.jpg'></a>\nNear the Chemnitzhuette</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14831201525'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3924/14831201525_d47919bb45_b.jpg'></a>\nWe have our own room!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14828131061'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3911/14828131061_99f80d913e_b.jpg'></a>\nAfter-dinner bouldering</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14830846662'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2910/14830846662_28f35d7a65_b.jpg'></a>\nRowan playing &quot;Halo&quot;</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14851074143'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3912/14851074143_a4b94de309_b.jpg'></a>\nMorning, time to go!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644584278'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3854/14644584278_ff42d38f3a_b.jpg'></a>\nBelow the Grosser Moeseler</p>\n<p>At the pass we were happy to have finished the elevation gain for the day. Now,\nwe just had a long and beautiful traverse northwards to the Chemnitzerhütte, our\nhome for the night. We passed a couple of beautiful lakes, and eventually the\nboys went off in front, we told them to hold dinner for us at the hut, as it was\ngetting late!</p>\n<p>The final slopes to the hut had some boulder scrambling and snowfields to\ncross. Folks were really nice at the hut, and after a great dinner, Elijah,\nRowan and I went out to play in the boulders. Elijah especially enjoyed trying\nto do the hardest climbs.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The weather was great the next morning, and we set off across alpine country\nmaking for the southern glacial slopes below the Großer Möseler, one of the\nhigher peaks of the region. Soon, the view before us was filled with snow and\nice, but sun and babbling brooks made our immediate environment really lovely.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14828138791'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2936/14828138791_b4274a6246_b.jpg'></a>\nBelow the Neveser Glacier</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14828861524'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2925/14828861524_07b5cf5350_b.jpg'></a>\nRowan loved his binoculars</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14828140041'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3878/14828140041_40df3b2e0a_b.jpg'></a>\nNapping below the Breithock</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14851082593'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3919/14851082593_443eeb8ebc_b.jpg'></a>\nBeautiful granite footpath</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644687857'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5596/14644687857_53abafb202_b.jpg'></a>\nA little more bouldering</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14808226496'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2920/14808226496_e642db5780_b.jpg'></a>\nRowan practicing slabs</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14831218235'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5551/14831218235_97b443641e_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Neveser See</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14828870194'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2917/14828870194_09f0a1a47a_b.jpg'></a>\nKris getting heavy metal</p>\n<p>I had a strange accident, where I stepped on a rock on the side of the trail\nthat was kind of a &quot;trap door.&quot; Before I knew what was happening, I was hurtling\nstraight down in rocks and brush on the side of the trail! Luckily, I stopped\nafter about 10 feet. Wow...that got the blood running! I recalled that only once\nbefore had I had any similar accident...it was in 2001 on an ill-fated attempt\nto climb Mount Challenger, when I slipped on wet heather and took a ride\nstraight down the hill for about 15 feet. Crazy stuff!</p>\n<p>Anyway, on this day we walked seemingly forever, but we took a lot of nice rests\ntoo. We ate snacks, napped, looked down at the beautiful lake below us (the\nNeves Stausee). We had to travel a bit downhill and then back up again in the\nlast hour before reaching the Edelrauthhütte, but this was no problem.</p>\n<p>At the hut, we settled in for dinner, noticing that it started to rain\noutside. We planned to head south for another day, but a look at the map\nrevealed that it would be an exceptionally long day to reach the next hut. We\ndecided to go down to Lappach instead, especially since the weather forecast for\nthe next days was poor. The boys made a friend, gathering with him around a game\nof Minecraft.</p>\n<p>So we hiked down and east to the Neves Stausee in the morning. The boys helped\nherd some errant goats south along the lake to join their friends. The dam at\nthe end of the lake was quite impressive, then a last steep trail led down into\nthe valley underneath the dam. We talked about what to do if the dam broke!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644692377'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3858/14644692377_936f7eb53b_b.jpg'></a>\nSnow below the Eisbruggscharte</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14830864942'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3847/14830864942_d5e323e957_b.jpg'></a>\nDinnertime</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644598128'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5595/14644598128_5c070ca82a_b.jpg'></a>\nAbove the Pfeifholdertal</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14831224865'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5560/14831224865_891b24321a_b.jpg'></a>\nHeading down to the lake</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644519750'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3869/14644519750_33407000bc_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Neveser See</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14644576539'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5557/14644576539_3c22c4fdea_b.jpg'></a>\nThere is a dam there</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14831229915'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5591/14831229915_1743f2984a_b.jpg'></a>\nMy family</p>\n<p>We came down to Oberlappach on the road, and 20 minutes later we were back at\nthe car. We got some gelato and a drink, then as if on cue, the thunderclouds\nburst open right after we got in the car. We had outrageous rainstorms all the\nway back over the pass.</p>\n<p>On the way home, we stopped to ride a summer mountain rollar coaster and do a\nropes course at Oberaudorf, making for a very full day!</p>\n<p>This was good fun. I love hiking with Kris and the boys so much.</p>\n"}
