We thought we&#39;d\nsee as far as we could get. There was a lot of snow for this time of year,\nand once on the ridge crest we were post-holing quite a bit. The views\nwere fantastic though, however a cloud and cold wind hovered above us,\nand the best option was to keep moving.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, one other fella was out on this day with the same idea.\nWe bagged a few peaks on the ridge together then Josef and I continued\non. He didn&#39;t know how far we&#39;d get, but he knew a way down from a previous\nattempt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5112296502/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1214/5112296502_b6bf255b6e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5111697777/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1045/5111697777_01ee01a20d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5111703051/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1154/5111703051_ec6dfb4609.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5111700513/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1371/5111700513_7e16e65e99.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5111702105/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1349/5111702105_2664871c2d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We ended up descending the same way as Josef did beftore due to the late\nhour and heavy snow. It might be a long ways further before we could safely\nhead down into a valley. Thanks for the fun hike, Josef!</p>\n"}
