We left her place at 8 in the morning.\nShe was shocked that I didn&#39;t want to leave earlier. Maybe I&#39;m\nrelaxing a little bit!</p>\n<p>I&#39;d tossed around several ideas for where to go. She was sad that I\ndidn&#39;t have a climb where we needed harnesses and rope, so I decided\non the Maukspitze because at least she&#39;d get to use her hands on some\nhigh-quality Kaiser Stein!</p>\n<p>We found the parking lot, and started up. We had one pack. A liter of\nwater and four bananas. We travel pretty light!</p>\n<p>We talked about all kinds of things on the way up. Our lives go on.\nThey aren&#39;t simple. There are real issues, real &quot;problems&quot; that we\nhave no choice but to work with. And why should it be different?</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30660917886'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5349/30660917886_6449469029_b.jpg'></a>\nSchattenspiel</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30063837783'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5688/30063837783_15fd32a657_b.jpg'></a>\nMy girl</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30580855592'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5507/30580855592_6aab232e41_b.jpg'></a>\nSie steht am Grat</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30660867036'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5675/30660867036_3e2b436434_b.jpg'></a>\nBarbara and our climb</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30063835793'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5541/30063835793_ba2f01caae_b.jpg'></a>\nShe comes down</p>\n<p>Suddenly we were above the clouds in bright sun. In general, there was\nan appearance throughout the day of ever greater clarity. I don&#39;t think\nwe&#39;d deserve such clear, crisp sight if we didn&#39;t have to struggle in\nthe world a little bit.</p>\n<p>There were only a few other hikers here and there. Barbara left her ski\npoles and jacket at a good place, and we started scrambling on clean rock\nand hummocks of grass. We stopped at a lookout point and admired the toy\nlandscape below. We were in a kind of heaven.</p>\n<p>Higher, we reached a steep cliff and started up. It&#39;s grade II rock climbing,\nwhere a few pieces of metal offer assistence now and again. Two spicy\ntraverses woke Barbara up pretty good. Higher, her foot slipped just after\na section of snow which made her boot wet. &quot;Now I&#39;m awake!&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>Later, we carefully climbed out of a cave with the help of a fixed rope and\nmetal. A younger couple descended here in a strange way, avoiding the traverse into\nthe cave and just lowering themselves by knots in the rope. This made me tense,\nand Barbara too. Ach! But we climbed up okay, and resolved to traverse into the\ncave if we came back down this way.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30580844862'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5778/30580844862_573d5eca2c_b.jpg'></a>\nHmm, ein Bohrhaken?</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30697858225'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5578/30697858225_4a19a25f45_b.jpg'></a>\nOh, Maukspitze!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30697863125'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5342/30697863125_533236a455_b.jpg'></a>\nNice to be here again</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30580847052'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5453/30580847052_ee7187fb8f_b.jpg'></a>\nSelfie</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30731096411'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5705/30731096411_a63887af0e_b.jpg'></a>\nBarbara and our climb</p>\n<p>Higher, looking at the time, I decided to skip the Ackerlspitze and only climb the\nMaukspitze. Any other choice would mean we&#39;d probably have to descend this steep\nclimb because of the early sunset. So we briefly left the trail to scramble\ndirectly to the ridge crest and gain the traversing route to the Maukspitze.</p>\n<p>Here, we saw a herd of mountain goats on a flank of the Maukspitze. This was fantastic.\nWe sat on a grassy spur and watched, amazed at the crystal clarity of the air, and the\nangled fall light.</p>\n<p>We hiked a dramatic ridge crest to the summit. It was really one of the most beautiful\ndays I&#39;ve ever seen up there.</p>\n<p>We descended to the south, eventually reaching the scree basin below the grade II rock\nclimb. I thought we&#39;d left Barbara&#39;s ski poles there, so I climbed up to it only\nto eventually remember it was below the next scrambling section. My reward for the\nextra climb was Barbara admiring my manly scree skiing.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30697860655'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5581/30697860655_b24e975170_b.jpg'></a>\nHeh!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30065882894'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5692/30065882894_d8dbf84d05_b.jpg'></a>\nEveningtime...</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/30697866055'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5622/30697866055_4df6ed6d08_b.jpg'></a>\nI&#39;m going down from the Maukspitze</p>\n<p>In the sunset, we spoke with a couple staying at the Ackerlhütte, laughing about Halloween\nand (of course) Donald Trump. They said these days, America only exports terrible stuff,\nnot like when it was blue jeans and Coke. Now, it&#39;s killer clowns and Trump. WTF?</p>\n<p>We had one headlamp, but found our way down okay. Barbara has good night vision.\nWhat a good day, yet again!</p>\n"}
