{"date":"2009-4-28","title":"Martinswand, Auckenthaler Riss","blurb":"with Dan and Uli","description":"<p>Uli, Dan and I had a plan to climb the Gerberkreuz above Mittenwald. We\nworried about snow on the approach, but the rock looked dry and ready to\nclimb. However, when we got out at the parking lot it was damn cold! And\nit seemed like it might rain. We really wanted to be in &quot;the alpine,&quot; but\nthe risk of hiking 2 hours just to get rained out led us to drive south\nto the Martinswand.</p>\n<p>Pretty much the <a href=\"http://www.mountainwerks.org/mm/2008/10/martinswand.html\">last rock climb I did last year</a> was\nwhen Dan and I climbed the first 4 pitches of the Auckenthaler Riss on\nthe Martinswand. We had started late in the day after the Ostriss (VI)\nand &quot;Flying Grass (VII-),&quot; and just ran out of daylight. So it was funny\nto go back there now, intent on the same goal. But this time we were starting\nin the morning!</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bergsteigen.at/pic/pdf/289_Topo_23c3b2dc-674b-49aa-ab90-88bba25ca4c9_auckenthaler.pdf\">Auckenthaler Riss</a> is\nan old classic, and features VII- crack climbing. It&#39;s also quite polished.\nOn the other hand, it&#39;s been completely bolted, so the fear evens out!</p>\n<p>We scrambled up the rather serious approach. Uli took the first block\nof three pitches, first climbing a chimney with a cruxy move (V) at the\nstart of the second pitch. Then one more pitch led to the start of the\nAuckenthaler crack proper. Now I led a block. The first pitch had a dicey\nface move or two, then offered some jams in the crack. This was as high\nas Dan and I got last year.</p>\n<p>From this point the route is absolutely vertical for the next several\npitches. Some grade VI climbing led straight up with crack and face moves.\nWhen Uli came up, there was some excitement because he tested a little\ncolumn of rock on the right to see if he could use it. But it exploded\ninto pieces! Thankfully it all flew away and didn&#39;t hit Dan, who was climbing\nup about 10 meters below. Also, we saw another party had begun the route\nbelow, and happily because the route leans leftward for a long ways, they\nwere also safe. Whew!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/3482764444/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3482764444_ac57101a88.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>For my last lead I started up a vertical crack, then knew I was in the\ncrux VII- section because of my shaking &quot;elvis leg!&quot; I remember one good\nhand jam, although too low to reach up. Then a dime-edged face hold above\nthat. I had one foot jammed in the crack, and the other floating in space.\nSome kind of forgotten magic of swapping hands and smearing saw me through.\n&quot;Whoo!&quot; I yawped.</p>\n<p>Dan and Uli came up, finding it pretty exciting. Uli is new to crack climbing,\nso it was especially &quot;evil.&quot; :D.</p>\n<p>Now Dan led a block of three pitches, the first two continued the &quot;absolutely\nvertical&quot; theme. The second of those had a set of very delicate crux VII-\nmoves. Dan used a point of aid, as a piton with a fixed sling hung temptingly\nin the way. When following, I was able to avoid it, but just barely. It\nwas more of a face climb for a few moves, then there was a poor hand-jam,\njust slightly too high to power up on. You had to be patient and get your\nfeet a bit higher before you could yard on the jam. All the while, the\nInn River and highway pull at you from below. I think this part overhung\nslightly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/3481949795/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3375/3481949795_2cd9d7c4e2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/3481950523/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3596/3481950523_12f94cbf9a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Another easier pitch, then we were done! But Uli&#39;s book mentioned a 3\npitch grade V variation exit. &quot;Go for it, Uli, it&#39;s your block!&quot; So he\ntook off, combining the first two pitches. It was certainly a more fun\nway to exit the route than the ocean of dirty rock that makes up the normal\nway off to the left. The route tried to find a way up the most solid rock.\nEventually, we reached a little &quot;rescue station&quot; where the alpine rescue\nteam has stashed some gear and some strong anchors for rappelling down\nalong the Auckenthaler Riss. Here we unroped and hiked down in very strong\nwind.</p>\n<p>After the long hike, I still had energy, so we went to the OeAV Klettergarten.\nWe climbed two fantastic pitches as one 50 meter lead. The route was grade\nV, but felt harder, probably due to the terrible polish on the first slab\npitch. But these two pitches had a lot of variety: slab, pockets, cracks,\neven an overhang. That Klettergarten is quite large, we&#39;ll have to go back\nto it.</p>\n<p>On a funny note, I ate &quot;Goo&quot; all day, having recently re-read Mark Twight&#39;s\n&quot;Extreme Alpinism,&quot; and thinking I need to pay more attention to how I\neat in the mountains. It worked really well. I was so up, and could have\nkept climbing 2-3 more hours until dark. But the city called us home. Dan\nwas wasted from a transatlantic flight and Uli had dinner with Anna. I\ngot in just in time for dinner with the family too. A great day out!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/3481951709/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3544/3481951709_06b21b502f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"}
