He studies\nOrnithology (birds, to the layman) and had some neat stories. He got some\ngood pictures too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797978852/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3087/5797978852_f11815694e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797979318/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2491/5797979318_d3a079db77.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797979616/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5313/5797979616_5768271c89.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797979924/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2116/5797979924_e8220725b7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797425305/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3513/5797425305_329da053eb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5797980578/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/5797980578_7e377120d1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>It was a big hike, going up from the valley station of the Alpspitze lift\nto the summit with just a brief detour for struedel at the mountain station.\nI foolishly wore big honking mountain boots, but I guess that is good training\ntoo. We decided to be nice to our knees and take the lift down.</p>\n"}
