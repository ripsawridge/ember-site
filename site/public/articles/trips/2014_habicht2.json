First off, I was\naway for so long on Saturday that we didn&#39;t sync up. Sunday morning at 7 I\ncalled Danno to work out a trip. We would meet in Holzkirchen to carpool out to\nGschnitz in the Stubai for a climb of Habicht, which was in perfect shape.</p>\n<p>Alas! A terrible traffic jam followed. It was well after nine when we left\nHolzkirchen. We were hiking sometime after 11 am, a rather ridiculous time to\nstart for such a long hike, but oh well.</p>\n<p>We had some entertaining talks about the state of the world. And hilariously, I\ntried to get Danno to carry less gear, as usual, and he fought tenaciously to\nkeep his small supply of fruit and candy bars as usual. &quot;But the hut is open!&quot; I\nprotested. &quot;Let&#39;s just eat there!&quot;</p>\n<p>It was a pretty warm and sweaty hike up over 1000 meters just to reach the\nhut. I risked a sunburn by going shirtless, but the air felt good. We rounded a\ncorner to see the shuttered hut, realizing indeed that we wouldn&#39;t get\nlunch. The bigger problem was a lack of water. Some descending hikers gave us\nhalf a liter, which was super nice.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15399588897'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5609/15399588897_30b774428e_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking to Innsbruck</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15586433172'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3944/15586433172_b7407b0c30_b.jpg'></a>\nLate afternoon high point</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15582937311'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3951/15582937311_3f7e65cf05_b.jpg'></a>\nDescent</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15561916846'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3952/15561916846_bd8fc4c3bd_b.jpg'></a>\nMore views</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15399482478'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5612/15399482478_cfc8c13c86_b.jpg'></a>\nHeading home</p>\n<p>Nursing the disappointment from a lack of lunch, we huffed and puffed up onto a\nshoulder of the mountain. A descending hiker made a point to let us know we were\nirresponsibly late in this area, tapping his watch and wagging his finger\nunctiously. Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>Before long we crossed a gable to enter the southern flank. An entertaining\nscramble followed, occasionally protected by unnecessary cables. It was nice and\nwarm, the sun felt good and the clear air made for stunning views. Danno was\npretty tired, and even if I had some residual energy, it was clear we&#39;d end up\nscrambling down in the dark if we pressed forward. So we found a high point on\nthe ridge 400 meters below the summit, where the scramble trail heads off to\nanother ridge for the climb to the glacier.</p>\n<p>It was good to be here. We could see from the Karwendel to Italy, with the\nHochferner over in the Zillertal looking especially impressive. After hanging\nout a while, we hiked down pretty quickly, stopping for a delicious apple and a\ncandy bar at a pass near the hut. The final march to the car was a bit of a\nslog, but it was nice to see the evening shadows growing in this beautiful\nvalley.</p>\n<p>Alas! Again traffic bedeviled us. Why, God, why?! A couple of hungry guys\nfinally limped home to scrounge for food in their respective houses. Thanks\nDanno for the day!</p>\n"}
