We took the long way, first driving\nto Peshastin Pinnacles (quite wet), then to Vantage. We got there at noon,\nand decided to visit the Middle East Wall. Hoping to start easily, I led \n<b>Sleeping with the Fish (5.7)</b>, and really enjoyed an initial finger and hand\ncrack to a ledge. Above the ledge, there was a difficult bulge where I nearly\nfell. I had a good cam in at my feet, but suspected I would hit the ledge\nif I fell. I really had to use herculean effort (by my standards) to stay\nin the offwidth overhanging crack. There were no positive holds for hands\nor feet, so I struggled with an arm bar for a while. Chris pointed out a\npossible foothold, which I reached after three tries with blood boiling\nin my ears. That helped somewhat, and I could eventually stand up. Getting\na piece in to hang off of and rest was a priority, and I nearly thought it\nwasn&#39;t worth it because of the energy I had left (may as well fall!).\nI hung there and gradually came back to life, feeling completely wasted.\nThe final twenty feet of the climb were basically pleasant, with a left\ncrack for finger grips and a right hand crack. I clipped the anchors which\nwere about 3 feet below the mesa-top, then kept going for a strenous top-out.\nI wanted to get on solid ground! I rigged a belay, and Chris came up.\nHe found the bulge quite difficult too (definitely not 5.7). Getting from the\nmesa-top to the anchor for rappel was hair-raising (Chris was rigging cams\nto use as hand-holds).</p>\n<p>We walked back to an area with some other climbers. Here, Chris climbed \nan arete, <b>Savage Heart (5.10b)</b>, and set up a top-rope on <b>Sex Party (5.10a)</b>.\nI climbed that, finding it much easier than Sleeping with the Fish.\nIt was an awesome hand crack. Feeling better, I led <b>Teresa&#39;s Lingerie (5.9)</b>\nwhich was another incredible hand crack. I belayed Chris on that, then we\ntop-roped <b>The Elders (5.10a)</b>, a very nice crack to the left. Leland Windham\ncame along with a friend, and went off to climb Sleeping with the Fish,\nhaving heard from others that it was harder than rated (I&#39;m going to keep\nbeating this dead horse!). A climber named Ken suggested we climb <b>Shady\nChimney (5.7)</b> on the Sunshine Wall. He had also loaned me a great #3 hex\nfor Teresa&#39;s Lingerie. After this, we took off for the Sunshine Wall, stopping to\neat lunch and admire the scenery on the mesa top.</p>\n<p>It was Chris&#39;s lead, so I got to watch him struggle his way up the tight\nchimney. It was pretty funny, he apparently was unable to breathe in the first\nten feet. The lead took a while because many strange actions had to be\nperformed. I was excited to climb something so different. People kept walking\nby and saying &quot;yuck, why climb that?&quot; and &quot;who&#39;s in the chimney?&quot; Chris built\nan anchor on top of the huge chockstone that caps the climb (you tunnel\nthrough a hole in the back). I shed my jacket before climbing, thinking I&#39;d\nneed every bit of space my too-wide girth can find. It was hard to move at\nfirst, but it was really fun because it was so different. The chimney slowly\nwidened as I climbed, cleaning thin nuts Chris was able to place in the back\nwall. It wasn&#39;t hard, but continually interesting. Finally, it widened enough\nto be able to turn around, and then required the use of an excellent thin-hand\ncrack along with other holds at the end. Getting around the chockstone was\nunexpectedly easy, and I joined Chris at his makeshift belay as the sun\nturned the clifs red. People continued to ask how the climb was, obviously\nimagining all kinds of nastiness. I think of it as a sequel to <b>7 Virgins and\na Mule (5.7)</b>. Same difficulty, same ease of protection, but more variety.\nI&#39;ve also done the nearby chimney climb <b>Stroking the Chicken (5.6)</b>, which\nI found scary. It has two stars in the guidebook, but those stars should be\non Shady Chimney instead. Kenneth gave us a good recommendation! We finished\nthe day with a climb of <b>Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu (5.8)</b>, to it&#39;s upper anchor.\nWe fumbled in the dark to gather our gear, but the moonlight made the walk\nout straightforward. </p>\n<p>Oh and Leland walked by, having enjoyed <b>Sleeping with the Fish</b>, and reckoned\nthe route to be 5.10a. This was a really fun day.</p>\n<h2>March 22-23</h2>\n\n\n<p><i>\nTheron wrote about the 23rd at <a href=\"http://www.theronwelch.com/mountains/pnw/2003/index.htm\">\nhis web page</a>.\n</i></p>\n<p>Next Saturday, Chris Koziarz and I drove back to Vantage. We swapped leads \nall day, first at the Kotick Memorial Wall where</p>\n<p>Chris led a 5.10(?) bolted route left of Silhouettes (c)<br>\n<b>Game of Inches (5.9)</b>, just right of Silhouettes (m)<br>\n<b>Silhouettes (5.10a)</b> - very nice route, not hard (c)<br>\n<b>Old Friends</b> - a dirty 5.8 crack, not recommended (m)<br>\n<br>\nThen at the Sunshine Wall:<br>\n<b>Crossing the Threshold</b>, nice 5.8 crack (c)<br>\n<b>Air Guitar</b>, 5.10a crack - creepy lead due to Goran&#39;s fatal fall (m)<br>\n<b>Steel Pulse</b>, 5.10b bolted arete - I didn&#39;t climb this one, but Chris liked it (c)<br>\n<b>Tangled Up in Blue</b> - awesome 5.9 crack. My 2nd favorite route, great exit moves (m)<br>\n<b>George and Martha</b> - awesome 5.10a crack. My favorite route. (c)<br>\n<b>Pony Keg</b> - 5.10a crack (I got tired, had to hang on gear for a minute) (m)<br>\n<b>Vantage Point</b> - 5.8 bolted arete. Some of it fell apart on Chris&#39;s lead! (c)<br></p>\n<p>Chris went home and I camped out overnight, drinking hot chocolate and admiring the stars.\nI had my portable mp3 player, but left it on too long and the batteries died.\nSo I read a book and sat in my &quot;Crazy Creek Chair,&quot; what fun it can be camping by\nthe road!</p>\n<p>Theron and Kris came the next morning at 9:30, and we did some fun easier stuff.\nFirst we climbed 3 Feathers routes, where Theron did his first rock climbing leads.\nHe led the 5.0, a 5.4, and a 5.5. It was too cold and shady there, so next we\nwent to the Sunshine Wall. I led <b>Shady Chimney</b>\n(it was so much fun last week), and Theron followed it really well. Then Theron led <b>Peaceful\nWarrior (5.6)</b>, and Kris and I followed it. I also tried the 5.10 face variation,\ngetting about 3/4 of the way up before heading back into the chimney. I was\ngetting tired! Finally, Theron and I climbed the\n<b>Chossmaster</b>, a two pitch 5.7 bolted route that was really nice. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;ve\nnever done that one before. During the trip we ran into many people, including\nChucK, Scott P., Jack, Scott&#39;teryx, Carla\nfrom Glacier Peak, and others. There was a hell of a snowstorm going back home\nSunday night, we could barely see. My orthodontist was in the same storm, I heard him\nremarking about it the next day.</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/air_guitar.jpg\"><img src=\"images/air_guitar.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>You can see how well I protected Air Guitar.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/chris_air.jpg\"><img src=\"images/chris_air.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Chris following Air Guitar.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/chris_lead.jpg\"><img src=\"images/chris_lead.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Chris on Crossing the Threshold.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/goran_mem.jpg\"><img src=\"images/goran_mem.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>A memorial to Goran.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/chris_mesa.jpg\"><img src=\"images/chris_mesa.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Friend Chris on the mesa-top.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/chriscrowd.jpg\"><img src=\"images/chriscrowd.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>An amazing crowd near Tangled Up in Blue.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/dumbanddumber.jpg\"><img src=\"images/dumbanddumber.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>I wish we had been clowning around.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/kris_silly.jpg\"><img src=\"images/kris_silly.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Kris being silly.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/michael_shaft.jpg\"><img src=\"images/michael_shaft.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael deep in Shady Chimney.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/tandk.jpg\"><img src=\"images/tandk.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron and Kris at the Feathers.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/theron_choss.jpg\"><img src=\"images/theron_choss.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron on the excellent Chossmaster.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/eveninghands.jpg\"><img src=\"images/eveninghands.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Some dirty hands.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/theron_peaceful.jpg\"><img src=\"images/theron_peaceful.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron leading Peaceful Warrior.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/tmandk1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/tmandk1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Three satisfied climbers.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/tmandk2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/tmandk2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>I liked this one too.</i></p>\n"}
