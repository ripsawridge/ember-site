{"date":"2004-8-7","title":"Pickets Range Equipment","description":"<p><em>back to <a href=\"pickets.html\">Picket Range Traverse</a>...</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-equipment\">The Equipment</h2>\n<p><img src=\"images/a_equipment.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just for future reference, I thought I&#39;d record what I brought along on\nthe trip, and what our &quot;group gear&quot; was. Note that band-aids and duct tape\nonly became group gear because I forgot to bring some, so we went through\nTheron and Aidan&#39;s supply of those items pretty quick! In the picture you see\nour Betamid tent, purchased a few days before the trip at <a href=\"http://promountainsports.com/\">Pro\nMountain Sports</a>. \nYou can see my hiking poles holding it up (cheap REI\npoles, I go through two sets a year). Also two Black Diamond Ice Packs are\nvisible, belonging to myself and Aidan.</p>\n<p>We were really happy with our equipment. The only complaints were that we needed\nmore duct tape, Aidan&#39;s full-shank boots were too heavy, and we kept losing\nwater bags (by the end only I had one functioning water bag!). On a good\nnote it&#39;s amazing how long a small GigaPower fuel canister will last if you\njust use it to bring water to a boil once per day. Even with an extended\nsnow-melting session on the summit of Mt. Fury, we barely broke into our\nsecond fuel canister. Our dehydrated meals were especially good.</p>\n<table border=1> \n<tr>\n<td colspan=2>\n<b>Party gear:</b><br>\nsmall ice tool (3rd tool)<br>\n8.5mm 60 meter rope<br>\nmedium rock rack - cams, nuts, dyneema slings, nutrino carabiners, 2 pitons<br>\n2 ice screws, 1 snow picket<br>\n1 canister stove and pot, 2 small fuel canisters<br>\n1 bivy sack<br>\n1 Betamid floorless tent<br>\nAdvil<br>\nSleeping pills<br>\nDuct tape<br>\nBlister pads<br>\nMaps, beta printouts<br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\n<b>My terrain gear:</b><br>\naluminum crampons (Stubai)<br>\nlightweight ice axe<br>\nrock shoes (old 5.10 Spires)<br>\nHiking boots (Vasque Sundowners)<br>\nCassin Eolo Harness<br>\nHelmet<br>\nhiking poles<br>\nPack (Black Diamond Ice Pack), with back padding removed<br>\n</td>\n<td>\n<b>My clothing:</b><br>\ngaiters (OR calf-length)<br>\nshorts with zip-off pant legs<br>\nlong underwear<br>\n1 short sleeve shirt<br>\n1 long sleeve shirt<br>\nTiny, cheap windbreaker ($10 in 1996)<br>\nlight fleece jacket<br>\nWool hat<br>\nWool gloves<br>\nLiner gloves<br>\n2 pairs heavy socks<br>\n2 pairs liner socks<br>\n1 pair underpants<br>\n1 sunhat<br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>\n<b>Misc gear:</b><br>\nSunglasses<br>\nHeadlamp<br>\nSunscreen<br>\nKnife<br>\n2 Garbage bags<br>\nAltimeter watch<br>\ncompass<br>\nCamera, 4 rolls of film<br>\nCredit card, driver&#39;s license<br>\n</td>\n<td>\n<b>My Food gear:</b><br>\n5 dehydrated meals, with packaging removed from 3<br>\nLunch Nutella, Bread<br>\nSnacks power bars, goo<br>\n1.5 quart hydration bladder and tube<br>\nExtra 1 quart hydration bladder<br>\nMetal cup<br>\nSpoon<br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=2>\n<b>My sleeping gear:</b><br>\n3/4 length Thermarest (doubled as pack padding)<br>\nsummer down sleeping bag (40 degrees I think)<br>\n6&#39;x3&#39; groundsheet<br>\nEarplugs<br>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n"}
