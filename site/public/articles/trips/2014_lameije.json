First we tried to start by a fixed rope, but it\nwas really difficult with wet rocks. In general, things looked pretty wintry at\nthe moment! Later we realized we should descend around to the east side of the\nbuttress where a trail climbed back up to a point above.</p>\n<p>Now we scrambled for a long ways very enjoyably. Sometimes there were pretty\nexciting moves to do unroped, but overall the ledge system was remarkably\naccomodating...it was hard to believe it was a natural feature.</p>\n<p>Once done with the scrambling, we climbed snow for a few hundred meters to a\npoint below obvious crevasses. Here we added crampons and got out the rope. More\nclimbing through fresh snow got us to a high pass. The final climb to the pass\nwas pretty interesting. After crossing the bergschrund, I traversed fresh snow\nover rocks rather delicately. We reached the crest with some relief then started\ndown the opposite side. We could see the Promontoire Hut below at the base of an\nincredible rock buttress leading to the summit of la Meije. </p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15005229971'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5581/15005229971_bffa1c0237_b.jpg'></a>\nLe Meije and the pass</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821709948'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5551/14821709948_e2e4635760_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg at the pass.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15008332155'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3883/15008332155_01109e97e9_b.jpg'></a>\nClimbing down a novel way.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821686340'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3924/14821686340_ab9932eae4_b.jpg'></a>\nThe normal route on La Meije</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14985347286'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3853/14985347286_c511765c6f_b.jpg'></a>\nThe route from the hut</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15008337905'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5574/15008337905_ae4d213b0a_b.jpg'></a>\nInside the Refuge</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821681850'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3916/14821681850_e59cd37bab_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael gets above the &#39;schrund.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821690660'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3865/14821690660_d3dd25787d_b.jpg'></a>\nReady for snow shovel duty!</p>\n<p>There was actually a line of bolts to protect the descent, but we didn&#39;t know\nthat so we took the protectable line in a rotten gully choked with snow, ice and\nloose rock. We downclimbed three delicate pitches to reach snow, then easy\nwalking to the hut.</p>\n<p>The hut was marvellous. A little boy with a sword greeted us. The view was\nincredible. The warden made a special hot cider liquor for us which was\ndelicious. We also ordered a crepe made on the small stove.</p>\n<p>Before dinner we took a single rope and scrambled up a few pitches of the\nclimb. I fell in love with the amazing rock. I was so excited to climb the next\nmorning! The forecast seemed pretty decent. We knew we&#39;d have an enormous day,\nbut that was fantastic.</p>\n<p>All that fell apart at dinner. Two guides arrived, then communicated to us that\nthe route was not in condition. There would be a tremendous amount of wind the\nnext day. We would need to make a double rope rappel from one of the summits,\nand in high wind it is apparently a common occurance that the climbers rope gets\nstuck in this case, requiring rescue. The rocks would be verglased as well. I\nfound it hard to believe. Here, I could wear short sleeves outside!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821624189'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3850/14821624189_0d31f0b646_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg on a scouting trip.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821723988'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5552/14821723988_740b7655e3_b.jpg'></a>\nHeading down.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821627459'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5558/14821627459_0f48e5369e_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael making the best of it</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821727678'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3858/14821727678_90a5ff8675_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael scrambling.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821631179'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5554/14821631179_f3b7d2fee8_b.jpg'></a>\nThe entire scramble buttress</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821822507'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3839/14821822507_3101ab2bc0_b.jpg'></a>\nTo the lift station</p>\n<p>I grumbled and argued with Georg about it for a while. I think I realized this\nwas the last chance of the summer to do something really good, and I was feeling\nbad for passing up an opportunity to extend my four day hike from a few days\nbefore for an extra week. What a waste climbing can be sometimes. Down we would\ngo, under blue skies.</p>\n<p>After the warden and the guides delivered this message, it was funny to see the\nwarden say something to the effect of &quot;do whatever you want, don&#39;t let me\ninfluence you!&quot; when we said we were going down. Sigh.</p>\n<p>But don&#39;t get me wrong, the people who run that hut are pretty wonderful. We\nwere just disappointed, that is all.</p>\n<p>In the morning we reversed our route, finding the line of bolts for a much\neasier time. Down to the lift station, then the car, then a drive to Ailefroide\nwhere it began to rain and rain and rain...in disgust we quit for Munich.</p>\n"}
