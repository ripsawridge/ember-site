I&#39;d wanted to climb the Kasnapoff ever since Danno, Garon and\nI climbed the Vinatzer Route on the 3rd Sella Tower in July, 2009.\nFrom that route, we had a fantastic view across and down to the many\nclimbers on the Kasnapoff. It looked quite hard...a continuous vertical\nendeavor just left of the towers edge, and thus, perpetually in shade.</p>\n<p>After the forgettable first pitch, things got interesting: an entrancing\nvertical journey up cracks and small edges. Protection was sparse but\nadequate, I suppose. Steve and Ever kept me on the sharp end for the\nwhole climb, which was great for me (I&#39;m a notorious lead hog!). Belays\nwere cramped, and escaping for the next pitch involved climbing over\nor under smiling friends. A Swiss couple was behind us, but we\ntraveled at a similar pace so we weren&#39;t slowing them down (too much,\nanyway!).</p>\n<p>Ever was funny, she used every opportunity to take photos, many of which\nwere selfies. She knows how to center herself in her world! It was so\nmuch fun to climb with the two of them, such a happy couple. And since\nI&#39;d been climbing with Barbara just the day before, I didn&#39;t feel the\nslightest bit jealous of their cuddly companionship: I had it too...</p>\n<p>As we entered the middle of the route, our two topos diverged. Mine, from\nMauro Bernardi&#39;s excellent guide to Gr√∂den climbing suggested that after\nfollowing an easy ramp up and left, you should go straight up on grade\nIV terrain at near-constant difficulty to near the end of the route at\nthe sunny ridgetop. But Steve&#39;s new RockFax guidebook (I have some\npictures in this book!) opted for a harder variation. It&#39;s pitch 4)\nadvocated going &quot;up a few meters to a peg then traverse right on good\nrock (thread) to a stance by a yellow shattered niche.&quot; (Grade V).</p>\n<p>Well, I was feeling frisky and a harder variation definitely appealed\nto me! At this location (corresponding to the middle of pitch 5) in\nBernardi&#39;s topo), I traversed right on sparse holds, definitely hoping\nI was on the right track! I was very aware of Steve ad Ever directly below\nme, talking softly. After about 3 meters, I found a piton and clipped it\nrather gratefully. Whew! A few more moves reached the small stance.</p>\n<p>We watched as the Swiss couple made the traverse. Oh, I should add that\ncontinuing straight up as the Bernardi guide advocates was made less tempting\nbecause it looked quite wet. There is no better way to send climbers on a harder\nvariant than dripping water in cracks! Who knows, it might have been fine,\nand it seems that the routes diverge foe at least four pitches. One should\ncertainly return for the variant. Because the route was pretty empty today,\nwe didn&#39;t see anyone over there as time passed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"images/DSCF2337.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2337.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2347.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2347.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2349.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2349.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2357.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2357.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2361.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2361.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2362.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2362.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2365.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2365.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2366.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2366.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2376.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2376.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2379.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2379.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2381.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2381.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2385.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2385.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2390.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2390.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2402.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2402.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2405.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2405.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2407.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2407.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The guidebook describes the next pitch quite well:</p>\n<p>&quot;V+, 30 meters. From the niche, move up and right to a peg, and pull through\na bulge on a hidden side-pull, then move right for 1 meter onto the arete.\nClimb a shallow corner-crack -- smooth and tricky at first then easier -- and\ncontinue to easier ground and a stance on a large grassy ledge.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ha! What they describe as a bulge felt more like a bone-fide overhang. But it\nwas fun. The corner crack was spectaculer, and a somehow American variant to\nthe climb. Our Swiss friends opted for a steep face of edges and little protection\nabove the bulge.</p>\n<p>The crack intimidated me at first, but thanks to the huge array of cams Steve\nhad given me, I was able to really sew it up. By the end as it got easier, I\nfelt silly for placing so much gear. Anyway, the crack was good for hands.</p>\n<p>For pitch 6 we chose the first of three variations. Climbing a shattered\nchimney through rotten yellow rock (brief), then left and up for 40 meters to a niche\non the arete (Grade V). A last long and steep pitch (Grade V-, 40 meters) of\nthe shady north-facing style of most of the route led to a small stance on the\narete. Then a long and sunny climb (IV-, 50 meters) reached a sandy and sunny\nnotch on the crest where I belayed my charges from behind a big block.</p>\n<p>The final pitches were concerned with scrambling up beautiful edges and corners\nin the sun, taking many pictures and watching the paragliders over the Marmolada.</p>\n<p>What a fantastic climb. In a year where I&#39;d done very little, it restored my\nconfidence We descended, making an abseil or two, then scrambling for a long\ntime down steep corners and cracks.</p>\n<p>We went out for excellent pizza in Canazei. What a fantastic day, huge thanks\nto Steve, Ever and the spirit of these deeply beautiful mountains!</p>\n<p><a href=\"images/DSCF2411.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2411.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2412.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2412.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2414.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2414.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/DSCF2417.jpg\"><img src=\"images/DSCF2417.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1693.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1693.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1695.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1695.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1702.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1702.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1712.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1712.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1723.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1723.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1725.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1725.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1730.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1730.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1749.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1749.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1750.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1750.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1765.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1765.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/IMG_1767.jpg\"><img src=\"images/IMG_1767.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/P1070960.jpg\"><img src=\"images/P1070960.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a>\n<a href=\"images/P1070964.jpg\"><img src=\"images/P1070964.jpg\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n"}
