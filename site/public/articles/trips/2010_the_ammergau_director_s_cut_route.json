Parking\nat the wrong trailhead, I spent 20 annoying minutes walking on the flats\noutside of Graswang to get to the right place.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179512310/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5179512310_01dbb845e7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178911713/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5178911713_e44720894c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178914155/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1024/5178914155_4cd530d871.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178915939/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1325/5178915939_4511ebb52e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178918577/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1314/5178918577_44eb85c24a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178920355/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1334/5178920355_c6755a0986.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179527616/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1295/5179527616_252903e83b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>As I listened to interesting music, I quite enjoyed the hike up the Kuhalpenbach.\nAfter about 500 meters of elevation gain, I reached a road and walked east\non it for a while, before leaving it for the hike up to the Hasenjoechl.\nNow I&#39;d gained the ridge of the &quot;Director&#39;s Cut.&quot; I would traverse this\nfrom this point in a wide clockwise rotation of about 270 degrees back\nto Graswang, bagging 8 named summits along the way.</p>\n<p>It worked really well. I only encountered some tedious sections of snow\nat the Vorderer Felderkopf. Beyond that it was a beautiful fall day, with\nplenty of dry, brown grassy slopes. However the wind was quite strong a\nlot of the time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179530140/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1038/5179530140_ff7ab8d423.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178929771/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5178929771_4dc06a9930.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179537230/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1394/5179537230_d46f9ea360.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179539926/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1260/5179539926_ba3350b881.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5178941741/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5178941741_91c41808e4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5179554310/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1294/5179554310_27a3ac9eb0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I saw my first people below the Geissprungkopf, and then a continue stream\nof folks. It seems like a lot of people hike the three named summits on\nthe western side of the great arcing ridge.</p>\n<p>Back at the car at 2:45 pm, I realized that I could have easily climbed\nthe entire ridge, throwing in the Ochsensitz, Ziegelspitz and Notkarspitze,\ncertainly doable with another 1.5 hours of travel, and a bike shuttle to\nEttal for the start. I&#39;ll do this next time, having already proposed the\nname: the &quot;Extended Director&#39;s Cut.&quot; :D</p>\n<p>Pictures on Flickr <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157625393548922/\">here</a>.</p>\n"}
