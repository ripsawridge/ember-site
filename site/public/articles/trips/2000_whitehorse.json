{"date":"2000-2-20","title":"Whitehorse Mountain","blurb":"out of time","description":"<p>Peter and I had discussed climbing Whitehorse, a 6500 foot high mountain\nthat watches over Darrington. The mountain had been in the news over the\nlast year. For 15 years, a Bulgarian hermit had lived on the mountain,\nhiding in secret camps. Not wanting to harm animals, he occasionally\nbroke into country cabins to steal canned food. He never hurt anyone,\nbut eventually the townspeople had had enough, and the police nabbed\nhim. He lost a foot in the process, and won a lawsuit due to the severe\nmauling given him by a police dog. Now, he may be tried for treason\nin Bulgaria. What a story!</p>\n<p>But this mountain is how I imagine some lesser peaks in the Alps to be:\nA formidable glaciated peak looming over a village and tilled fields.</p>\n<p>The winter season this year has been incredible from a climbing standpoint.\nIt seems to have cleared for 4 days every two weeks or less, giving more\nweekend fun opportunities than usual. Our climb was at the close of such\na high-pressure window, and we hoped to beat the clouds we knew would\narrive by sundown.</p>\n<p>We settled on the standard route, but also discussed the Whitehorse\nGlacier as a possibility. Wanting to avoid avalanche terrain, we discarded\nthis idea, since it gets a special mention for that type of danger.\nPeter invited \nJake, who brought experience (he&#39;d been on part of the\nroute before) and mind-boggling stories of his adventures\nin the mountains. He&#39;s currently on an envious climbing binge!</p>\n<p>Jake had been to the trail two weeks before, unable to drive the car\nover snow to the 800-foot high trailhead. He was shocked that all that\nsnow had melted to about 2000 feet. The three of us geared up and chugged\nup the steep switchbacks of the lower trail, getting a 5:30 am start.\nSurrounded by gloomy forest, we lost tracks in the snow at an avalanche\nchute. Prudently, we headed 800 feet straight up through forest until we\nmet tracks again on the ridge-top. Here, we saw a brilliant red sky behind\nGlacier Peak, and the panorama of mountains to the north. We could see\ninto the Picket Range, Mt. Baker, and many peaks to the northeast.</p>\n<p>At 4000 feet the tree cover lessened, and we found ourselves in a sloping\nbasin with awesome views onto the Whitehorse Glacier to our east. Our\nslope faced north, and for the next 2 hours we fought deep, powdery\nsnow that fell apart like sand. We crossed about 150 feet of avalanche \ndebris.\nThe avalanche had originated at least 300 feet above in a tight colouir.\nThe rocky cliffs above had unusually light snow-cover for this time\nof year, so we weren&#39;t very worried about additional slides. Still, my\nthoughts were very insecure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/whglacier.jpg\" alt=\"This is what we came for, such excellent alpine scenery!\">\n<img src=\"images/hillock.jpg\" alt=\"A nice viewpoint at the top of Lone Tree Pass.\">\n<img src=\"images/oncorn.jpg\" alt=\"Our view down to the north bowl was awesome from here.\">\n<img src=\"images/badslope.jpg\" alt=\"This section was a little hairy. We didn&#39;t want to disturb the slope.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/mebelow.jpg\" alt=\"We were a little apprehensive about these cornices heating up in the morning sun. They were soon back in shade though, as their northeast aspect and a high pass to the south prevented too much sun.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/peterlow.jpg\" alt=\"Peter&#39;s vitality, as you can see, carried us through. This is one of the few occasions he wasn&#39;t breaking trail...\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/longslope.jpg\" alt=\"On the left is a tempting gully we were sure was the way to the summit. But Jeff&#39;s emailed notes prevented us from climbing it. He described it to a T.\">\n<img src=\"images/threef4.jpg\" alt=\"Looming clouds over Three Fingers Mountain.\">\n<img src=\"images/allofus.jpg\" alt=\"Peter did a great job setting up the camera on a teetering snow block.\"></p>\n<p>After this point, we took turns breaking trail through steep snow up to\nLone Tree Pass, stopping at a clump of trees for some food and a chance\nto enjoy the scenery. Somebody was target shooting down in the valley.\nWe tried to pick out Eldorado Peak, but couldn&#39;t distinguish it from\nthe dozens of snow peaks nearby.</p>\n<p>Once at the pass, we continued on the ridge top for a short distance,\nreaching a clear area with a snowy &quot;view-hump.&quot; We took quite a few pictures,\nPeter even got a self-timed picture of us all. The view was 700 feet straight\ndown to the basin we had climbed. Directly across was the Whitehorse\nGlacier, which appeared impassable due to two {\\em Bergshrunds}, 400 feet\napart from each other. They both completely bisected the slope. It would\nbe quite a feat to cross them.</p>\n<p>Here I relunctantly voiced my fears about continuing, mainly the \navalanche chute\nbelow gnawed at me, also I was tired and knew we had a world of\nexhausting travel ahead of us. I knew we also had some technical terrain\nat the end, and more possibly dangerous slopes on the south side,\ngetting their full compliment of sun. Peter and Jake pointed out that\nthe avalanche area we had crossed earlier was already back in shade, and\nthis eased my mind considerably. After a drink, I felt ready to keep\ngoing. I also couldn&#39;t\nbelieve I was on a mountain that I would consider formidable in\nsummertime...and it was deep winter! That&#39;s one of the coolest things\nabout this climb though!</p>\n<p>We kept traversing east on the south side of the ridge, looking for the\nright gully to turn up to the 6000+ foot High Pass. We had dropped\n400 feet, but slowly regained that altitude as we traversed. We emerged\nin an open area beneath a gigantic rock buttress, with a tempting\ngully going up to it&#39;s right. That must be our gully, we thought. But\nPeter had gotten detailed notes from Jeff, who had visited this area\nlast year. Very clearly, his notes stated that this was the wrong gully.\nHe and Mat had climbed it, &quot;sealing their fate&quot; by topping out at\nsome impassable obstacle. Darn! We were tired of traversing and ready\nto head up to the glacier. Jake and Peter did the lions share of plowing\nfurther on around a corner to a clump of trees on a steep hillside.\nFrom this point, we saw a huge colouir capped by a striking rock tower.\nThis was certainly our route, and yet we were too high. The right thing\nto do is to drop 400-500 feet, stay low on a bench, and climb again\nonly when you are at the bottom of this colouir. From our vantage\npoint, we had almost a mile of steep slopes and gullies to cross if we\nwanted to get there. We could see the bench 500 feet below us.</p>\n<p>To add insult to injury, the weather had arrived. Blue skies turned to\nsilvery white wisps, and then quickly to dull gray hummocks. For much\nof the way since Lone Tree Pass, we had a view of Three Fingers, and\nit&#39;s appearance became more forbidding as the clouds rolled over it\ntowards us.</p>\n<p>And so we turned around at 1:30 pm, having been on the move for 7 hours.\nBy the time we got back to the ridge-top, it was snowing lightly. Here\nwe met two skiers with their long tele boards strapped to their back.\nThey thanked us for the steps that made their climb easier! Coming\ndown from the pass was quick, we removed our snowshoes and plunge stepped,\ngetting covered in snow, but enjoying the quick ride down. With each\nstep, you could slide several feet, and we got several standing and\nsitting glissades in too. Crossing the avalanche chute was trivial, but\nthe minor vertical gains we had to make after this wiped me out.\nA boost of energy came during excellent glissades down into the forest.\nPeter and Jake held contests to see who could &quot;ski&quot; off the\nbiggest drops.</p>\n<p>We decided to glissade that first chute, knowing that the skiers (and their dog,\ndid I mention that?) had come up that way. Wheee! The sweet reward for\nhours of toil -- the sitting glissade! To ride in comfort down the mountain,\nlooking at pastures below, giving your aching legs a rest...We brought\ncartloads of snow down with us, Jake and I got bonked in the back by some\nbigger chunks. I laughed when a &quot;snow boulder&quot; whizzed down into a tree\n(that I steered to the left of) and smashed into 17 little boulders.</p>\n<p>Jake scouted for the spot to enter the forest again, and it was the dog\ntracks that led us to the right spot. The trail here became very difficult,\nsince the snow had warmed, providing alarming moments where your step\ncollapses and you are up to your waist in a hole, possible well-lodged-in\nby vines or roots. Jake fell in this fashion, turning a somersault after\nlosing his balance (a hand thrust out to grab a sapling saved him from\ninjury), and Peter got his foot stuck under a branch, getting trapped\nand nearly injuring a knee. Yes, the curses were flying in this hard,\nbitter forest...</p>\n<p>We had a laugh when Jake grabbed a Devil&#39;s Club vine to get around a\nfallen tree (it was that or fall). I squirmed under the tree, and Peter\nfound another way over. As the light faded, we zoomed down the switchbacks\nof the forest, reaching the car at 5:30, 12 hours after our climb started.</p>\n<p>What did I learn from this trip? What I learn from every winter trip:\nwinter is hard! Oh, and a pint of Guinness to sooth the aching muscles\nis not an optional component when the mountains leave you bruised and\nsore. Also, I have some great stories from Jake to pass on. Thanks guys!</p>\n"}
