{"date":"2008-3-15","title":"Ski touring with Silas","description":"<p>Silas Wild and his daughter Jen were coming to Austria for weeks of\nskiing. I knew Silas from slide shows back in Seattle, and from reading\nJohn Roper&#39;s entertaining story about the first ascent of the\n``Wildhair Crack&quot; in the Picket Range. He is a spare, powerful ball of\nenergy, and it was awesome to have the chance to go skiing with two\ngenerations of Wilds.</p>\n<p>They had been warming up in the Stubai and Karwendel Mountains around\nInnsbruck, where they stayed with a friend. I drove down Saturday\nmorning, and after an enlightening talk with their friend ``Wolfi,&quot; who\nhas climbed every single thing in the Alps (seemingly!) we drove down\nto the Dolomites for the weekend. The forecast wasn&#39;t great, but it\npromised more sun down south than north of the alpine crest.</p>\n<p>Silas is thinking about bringing folks over here for ski tours when he\nretires, so Jen and I had to go along with his plan to stop at every\ntourist office along the way and paw excitedly through the full-color\nbrochures showing the attractions of each area. We liked how in the\npaintings of the mountains around a town, showing the different ski\nlifts and trails, the town seemed to be the center of the\nuniverse. And there was never information about the next town 5 miles\naway. </p>\n<p>We drove up the narrow road to the Platz Wiesen (<em>Prato Piazza</em>), \nwhich\nhas an impressive view of the Hohe Gaisl across the valley. We put on\nour skis and started skinning up the Duerrenstein (2839 meters), at a\nsteady pace that nonetheless allowed us to admire the Dolomite\nscenery, which is so varied and exciting. I got to ask Jen what it was\nlike growing up with a mountain-goat for a Dad. Near the top, the wind\nreally picked up and the clouds came down. Jen still doesn&#39;t\nunderstand this peak-bagging motivation (or understands it too well!)\nso she thought about waiting for us, but it was just too cold to stand\nstill! So we all went to the summit, enjoying a narrow ridge 5 minutes\nfrom the top. We wished the weather was better, but we did get to see\nthe Drei Zinnen for a moment before the clouds lowered. </p>\n<p>I kept the Wilds in front of me for most of the descent, trying to\npick up tips by mimicking their expert turns. The snow was pretty icy,\nbut the 950 meters down to the car went very quickly. We felt really\ngood, but couldn&#39;t see anything else to occupy us here for the\nafternoon, so we decided to drive down to Brunico and stay there for\nthe night. It was great fun seeing Silas so excited at the cute little\nvillages. He collected another 3 dozen pamphlets for light reading\nlater. We stayed outside of town in a village called Sankt Martin, and\nthough it was snowing heavy flakes, I felt energetic enough to go\njogging for an hour up the forested peak behind the town. This was a\ngreat mini-adventure in itself. When the trail quit going up, I set\noff straight up the slope, with root and branch for hand-holds, then\nfollowing game trails in the forest. It was kind of a magical forest,\nwith soft heather underfoot, and evening light filtering through the\ntrees, along with the occasional snowflake. Without time to reach the\ntop, I practiced my route-finding skills by returning along ledges and\nridges the way I came, at one point startling a deer.</p>\n<p>We had a great dinner, though because it was Good Friday, they served\nno meat! The restaurant was right across the street from the town\nchurch, and we wondered if that played a role or not!</p>\n<p>In the morning, we drove through St. Vigil then up the long Rautal\nvalley to the end at Pederu. The cliffs on the north side of the road\nwere amazing, and beautiful with their new dusting of snow which\ncontrasted nicely with the brilliant blue sky. It would be a perfect\nday!</p>\n<p>We skied up into the Fanes Valley (<em>Valun de Fanes</em>), with the views\njust knocking us out. We didn&#39;t have a map or a guidebook (Silas had a\nlot of full-color pamphlets, but he didn&#39;t get where he is by spending\nmoney needlessly!) so we were kind of surprised how long it took to\nget back in to the Lavarela Hut. But we had to take lots of pictures\nand look at more slopes to ski on future trips. At the Hut, Silas was\nso impressed that he planned to stay for a few days, while I took Jen\nback to Munich for her flight home the next day. Then he&#39;d hitchhike\nhome, or some other scheme which just made Jen roll her\neyes. Sometimes Dads are embarrassing! But the hut was full, so Silas\nhad to whip on his skis and go check the Fanes hut for a\nvacancy. Waiting in the sun, Jen got a tan and I got a sunburn. By the\ntime he got back it was well after 11...pretty late to start a long\nski tour! &quot;Wolfi would kill us, don&#39;t tell him!&quot; implored Silas.</p>\n<p>We were making for a peak called Zehner, across a long high plateau\nwith little lakes. Jen decided to hang back, so it was just us old\nbergstormers. Silas kept telling me to go on ahead, living as he was\nin some alternate reality where I had the strength of 10. But soon we\nwere occupied with a cloud of snow, dropping in on us from the west,\nand obscuring the impressive slabs of the Neunerspitze on our\nright. These slabs look out of place in the Dolomites, seemingly\ntransplanted from Yosemite. They offer 6-7 pitches of excellent\nclimbing, and I hope to come back for them.</p>\n<p>The clouds dropped and lifted repeatedly, happily tracks and wide open\nslopes kept us on the right path. We slowed down a bit on the final\nslopes of the peak, entertaining ourselves by speaking only German,\nwhich would have sounded hilarious to real German speakers. But they\nhad all left, we seemed to be the last people on the peak. At the ski\ndepot, we looked up at the intimidating climb to the summit, which\nwe&#39;d call impossible without the iron cable to make it easier. With\ncloud on the left, and blue sky on the right, it beckoned us\naboard. Swinging up the occasionally vertical ridge from cable to\ncable, we were breathing a little hard, now just above 3000 meters.</p>\n<p>&quot;Should we head down?&quot; I said after 2 minutes in the biting\nwind. &quot;Hell yes,&quot; said Silas with a backward glance - he was already\nstarting down! We had to be careful on the icy rock, but soon we were\nback at our skis, where Silas led the way to little powder stashes on\nthe face. Unfortunately we were a bit late, and the snow had started\nto develop a crust. It was still a great ski down. At one point\nthough, I hit a rock which sent me flying. My face hit the snow so\nhard, that it froze painfully. I fumbled in my pack for some dry\nclothes to wipe my face off, mewling piteously all the while. Then we\nwent down to the plateau, and had to travel fast in the driving snow\nbefore tracks were obliterated. Back near the hut, Silas, the old\nwizard, led me over some small cliff jumps which took me by\nsurprise. I cratered comically, having to laugh a little bit. We\nstumbled into the hut, semi-frozen, where Jen was worried about us.</p>\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re fine!&quot; we said. Well mostly! Silas had an old injury flare up\nand bother him. So when the hut owner offered him a ride down in his\nsnow-cat, he couldn&#39;t refuse. Jen and I wanted to ski, so we did,\nthough rocks in the road near the bottom did some damage to our skis. </p>\n<p>Sadly our weekend was over, but I enjoyed the company so much. It made\nme look forward to when my kids are Jen&#39;s age. They can drag me up\nmountains and we&#39;ll have many shared experiences to laugh about.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Silas and Jen for a great time!</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/zehner-1.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny approaches the summit of Duerrenstein\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-2.jpg\" alt=\"Silas and Jenny near the summit\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-3.jpg\" alt=\"Cliffs above Pederu\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-4.jpg\" alt=\"Like father like daughter in the Fanes valley!\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-5.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh snowfall added to the scenery\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-6.jpg\" alt=\"Many intriguing ski peaks along the way\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-7.jpg\" alt=\"Silas marching up to Zehner in light snowfall\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-8.jpg\" alt=\"Zehner in the distance\">\n<img src=\"images/zehner-9.jpg\" alt=\"Silas on Zehner.
