She loved it, and long declared it to be her favorite one.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d been keeping weekends free so we could depart for Gardena on short notice\nwith good weather. I also knew that by mid-October we could expect snow on\nledges of this north facing wall, so I wanted to go before then. One Tuesday in\nMunich, I idly checked the forecast to see three great days for the weekend down\nthere. Yes! Thursday night we booked a pension, and were joined by our friend\nCesar, veteran of a previous Dolomites adventure.</p>\n<p>We headed down after work Friday, the adults breaking into the excellent Maple\nWhiskey Cesar brought from Montreal. Woo hoo!</p>\n<p>In the morning, Elijah said &quot;my throat hurts!&quot; Groan! I&#39;d been fighting a cold\nsince the Oktoberfest night earlier in the week with my team at work. And maybe\nI passed it to him. We decided to go anyway and just see how far we get.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15380073771'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3928/15380073771_d847d45694_b.jpg'></a>\nYes, this is Cesar</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196510689'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3862/15196510689_e6e16e569d_b.jpg'></a>\nElijah and Cesar</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382955232'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3885/15382955232_3bf4701ea2_b.jpg'></a>\nRowan clipping his own way</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382957902'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3921/15382957902_eb3976fc0a_b.jpg'></a>\nIt&#39;s getting pretty airy.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196765317'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2945/15196765317_f5715daa91_b.jpg'></a>\nCool customer</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15380086941'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3862/15380086941_6724408d97_b.jpg'></a>\nEvery upward.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196683198'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3868/15196683198_68cc45ebd6_b.jpg'></a>\nBoys in a cave</p>\n<p>Everyone had all the right gear, we were a small army! We marched from the pass\non the trail up and west, then traversing the mountainside below north faces. A\nwrong turn meant we had to descent a loose scree hill (&quot;Michael!&quot; said\nKris). Finally we were at the base of the route. Smarties all around, then we\nstarted up with Kris in front, Elijah, Cesar, Rowan and myself. Cesar and I had\nropes to secure the kids if needed. We wouldn&#39;t need these at all, but it was\nthe first time for the boys to have their own gear to clip with, and this did\ntake extra energy.</p>\n<p>We climbed a long time, with Kris especially enjoying herself up in front,\nbasking in previous memories and feeling very free! Cesar took a bunch of\nhilarious selfies. It&#39;s so much fun to be together out there with the boys,\ntoo. What a perfect, perfect day and man, I am thankful to be a dad at this\nstage of life!</p>\n<p>We took a rest when the angle relented, then set off again. I climbed with\nElijah now, and did more of his clips for him because he got noticably more\ntired. Above the waterfall, after a long steep section we made a short traverse\nand I rigged a handline along a narrow ledge so we could have an extended rest.</p>\n<p>Here, we could exit to an easier way to the hut. I was a little worried, because\nElijah was really tired. I&#39;d already decided to go that way with him, but we\nrested a while to see if there was improvement. I was still a bit amazed that he\nput up no fuss and was content to go the easier way. Rowan was eager to continue\nfor the &quot;crux,&quot; a couple of ladders and steep ground leading to the tiny\nsuspension bridge that marks the end of the route. I was super happy that Cesar\nwas there, so he could go with Kris and Rowan while Elijah and I took the exit.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382966042'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2949/15382966042_f60c80560e_b.jpg'></a>\nLove the shoes</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196685148'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3920/15196685148_c3565e3e3d_b.jpg'></a>\nKris and Rowan</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382975162'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2948/15382975162_e9e34c4b8a_b.jpg'></a>\nOh yeah</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382978062'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3849/15382978062_927bac737c_b.jpg'></a>\nDecision point ledge</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196695818'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3883/15196695818_2afc4097f7_b.jpg'></a>\nIt&#39;s a popular hike!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196788217'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2944/15196788217_3efb243d09_b.jpg'></a>\nMassive views</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15360280946'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2948/15360280946_58da5b9b9f_b.jpg'></a>\nThe bridge looks fantastic from here.</p>\n<p>Once I knew it was safe, I could unrope and walk the trail easily with\nElijah. We had a fantastic view of Kris, Cesar and Rowan on the climb which was\nreally impressive looking! I took many pictures. Later, we watched them cross\nthe bridge one at a time, and we whooped when each one stood at the midpoint of\nthe bridge.</p>\n<p>Elijah and I hiked to the hut, where he collapsed into a nap. We got a nice\nmeal. It was about 4 oclock. 30 minutes later, the family arrived. We ate and I\ngot nervous that we should head down soon. I really felt worried about getting\ncaught in the dark in the semi-technical descent gully. Everyone felt like we\nhad plenty of time, but I remembered how long descents can take sometimes!</p>\n<p>So in the early evening we started down. We put our harnesses and helmets on for\nthe cable-protected descent. I mandated a &quot;single-clipping&quot; strategy, where only\none carabiner was used. We have to try and be efficient now, it was getting\ndark.</p>\n<p>But still, we had fun, and I was happy to see that Elijah was okay as long as he\ndidn&#39;t have to walk uphill which really tired him out. Eventually we finished\nthe technical terrain, then had some fun with a steep and icy snowfield. Kris\ndid especially well with that.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196614970'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2948/15196614970_f3d5872306_b.jpg'></a>\nIMG_3635.jpg</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196795287'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2943/15196795287_b9885bd92b_b.jpg'></a>\nYep.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196797827'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2946/15196797827_00ba3a5959_b.jpg'></a>\nA Mexican Selfie</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196800317'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2945/15196800317_c0230f064f_b.jpg'></a>\nKris, Rowan and Cesar</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15382997962'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2946/15382997962_a782c3ca10_b.jpg'></a>\nElijah was worked here!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196558679'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2947/15196558679_d2ee750cb3_b.jpg'></a>\nThe hut for late lunch</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15196630390'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3853/15196630390_05fa12ece7_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the way down</p>\n<p>As we reached the trail of the morning it got almost full dark, and the stars\nwere out. Elijah was dead beat by the end, and I compounded things by helping\nhim take off his helmet at the car and pinching his skin painfully. Doh! Finally\nit was all too much!</p>\n<p>But soon we were in the warm car, driving away in the dark to a warm bed and a\ntake out pizza for dinner. This was an epic full day for the kids. They did\nfantastic, and we made some good memories.</p>\n<p>The next day we hung out in a meadow looking across at the Langkofel. Cesar put\nthe boys through some training paces, and we played a game of baseball with a\npincecone and a log for a bat. It was just me at the boys for that, so they had\nto &quot;spawn&quot; copies of themselves to be able to bat and leave players on the\nbases!</p>\n<p>What a full and fantastic weekend, thanks so much for joining us Cesar!</p>\n"}
