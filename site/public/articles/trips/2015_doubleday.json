I started doing two hikes in one day, simply turning\naround when I ran into snow, and rambling up a nearby trail. I really enjoyed\nthe process then, and I thought it would be great to do with Jakob. For one\nthing, it &quot;simulates&quot; a much longer hiking day. Some people just can&#39;t hike more\nthan 4 hours! Let&#39;s see if Jakob is still smiling (even faintly) after Hike Two!</p>\n<p>The Weather Gods must have been listening in, because this startling memo was\nfound in a search of their archives at the end of the Third Age:</p>\n<pre><code>RE: Hikers on May Day (EMEA/Alpine)\n\n...Parsimonn, I think we&#39;ll go with your &quot;taking us for granted&quot; theory and let\nthem have it this time. I hope your ideas of &quot;widespread revitalization of\nbelief&quot; and a corresponding increase in subscriptions will follow. Aflak already\nloaded the water cannons and we&#39;re set for Friday. Pensieve reveals Munich\nresidents with high hopes/plans, these are ideal candidates. See you at\nSummerFun!\n</code></pre><p>So yeah, Friday turned out to be the worst weather day in a month. But darn it,\nI was boxed in! Jakob periodically tried to make me see reason, bringing\nforecasts, pressure maps, police blotter reports of hypothermic people getting\nlost, but I became steely-eyed: my thighs wouldn&#39;t survive another round of\noffice cheesecake without the invigorating injection of painful hiking, wet\nthough it may be! Picking up my impulse, Jakob became...well, fatalistic is the\nwrong word. But he was ready!</p>\n<p>So we set out from Munich at 6:45 in a slashing, angry rainstorm. Jakob brought\nbreakfast, these amazing rolls which I insisted on calling biscuits for their\ndense nutrition. Bread baked with cheese and actual chunklets of bacon inside\n(bacon!). They were very good and sustained us through the day, much like\nTolkien&#39;s <em>Lembas</em> cakes.</p>\n<p>First we drove to Schönau and it&#39;s quirky one-car parking lot. In a surrealistic\nstart to the day, we passed a brass band by the barn, and then a collection of\nlocal people somehow creating a bonfire in the rain in the middle of the\nsettlement. Later, the band would play, and their eerie recollection of bygone\neras serenaded us up the mountain.</p>\n<p>On the way up I amused myself by imagining I had to drive a car up this &quot;road,&quot;\nconstantly spinning out and inevitably ending up in a ravine 300 meters\nbelow. &quot;It&#39;s not a road,&quot; insisted Jakob factually. But eventually he got into\nthe game, wondering about the appropriate width of a vehicle to survive the\nnightmarish ascent. Speaking of cars, later, Jakob noticed a disturbing design\nflaw in the rear wheel case of my Toyota: a boxy compartment that seemed to have\nno other purpose than to catch and hold mud and small rocks! Indeed, as we\nexamined it we saw that it had already succeeded in this mission, holding a\nsmall cachement of...mud and small rocks! Now as I write, comfortably ensconsed\nin bed, I&#39;m apprehensive about how often I&#39;m carrying these undesirable\nburdens down in the basement. There are problems of DNA evidence, and so\nforth.</p>\n<p>But we enjoyed our hike up the steep, steep road slash trail. We passed the\nusually-friendly cluster of houses at an opening in the forest, then continued\nup a steep ravine leading to the Ascherjöchl (1458 m). At the <em>joch</em>, we found\nfairly deep snow, decorating the whole ridge. At this point we thought we might\nnot make it to the Heuberg summit, darn! But oh well, we&#39;d continue until we\nwere outright stopped.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16719736893'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7660/16719736893_60116cd331_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking to the Rofan</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/17153762169'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7784/17153762169_ac89fe2cc5_b.jpg'></a>\nJakob on top</p>\n<p>This area was fun. We had a long, often level romp along the ridge crest,\nenlivened by tantalizing glimpses of the ridge above when the thick clouds\nallowed it. Jakob remarked on the strange way nearby objects looked in the\nmist. Their sharpness in contrast to everything else provoked a sense of\nunreality. I noticed it too, as he appeared alarmingly sharp against the\ngeneralized gray backdrop. Were he to float away into the mist, smiling, I\nwouldn&#39;t have the right to be surprised later. (&quot;Well you said he <em>looked</em>\nstrange, didn&#39;t you?&quot;).</p>\n<p>We climbed through dripping latschen tunnels on steep and slippery\ntrails. Finally we met our outright stoppage: a long snow slope that would have\nto be traversed, then persistent snow cover on further steep ground to the\nsummit. But in the way that an ancient warrior values &quot;a good death,&quot; we felt\nthis was a good and fair spot to go back. For elevation training we&#39;d racked up\n900 meters (1550 - 650). That was more than we thought at the time. We glumly\nthought we&#39;d only climbed 700 meters, and Jakob said &quot;I guess we could do a\n<em>third</em> hike,&quot; with an air of despondent nobility.</p>\n<p>We sat for a while at one of the shuttered houses on the way down, happy to have\nsome general views. Jakob told an amazing four-part story of broken arms and\nhard bicycle lessons. You can&#39;t make this stuff up! We realized we&#39;d be highly\ncompatible hiking partners and so this objective of our trip could be checked\noff (coldly, by our social worker, Frau Beschriebenbiek, she of the tight bun,\nalong with us for the day despite the high heels). Back at the car we enjoyed a\nbacon biscuit, gulped some water, and headed out again. This time we parked at\nthe Krummsee and walked through a campground, aiming for the west ridge of the\nVoldöpper Spitze.</p>\n<p>We followed our noses up hidden stairs and wet fields, glad that the rain had\nstopped for a few minutes. We found a road and signs pointing to the summit. At\none point, the steepening trail led through what looked to my weary Pacific\nNorthwestern eyes like an industrial-scale clear cut. Two men came down,\nappearing very dashing and technical with shiny black hiking poles, and matching\nshiny black pant, glove and hat. As they passed, I wanted to point out to Jakob\nthe extreme value of poles, well-used on steep and slippery ground. But he was\nthe first to notice that these individuals were using the poles purely as a\ndecorative florish! They did none of the weight bearing, the cushioning, the\ntesting of mud-slope that I expected from a seasoned or technical use of the\nequipment!</p>\n<p>I was scandalized.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16717514274'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7668/16717514274_a094250e7f_b.jpg'></a>\nThis, I get?</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/17153754929'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7670/17153754929_05db49324d_b.jpg'></a>\nJakob has a towel</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/17339989605'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8727/17339989605_44843935a7_b.jpg'></a>\nSomeone.

Well, let&#39;s move on.</p>\n<p>The relentless ridge trail was tiring me out. Here, typical of engineers, we\nattempted to gauge our relative levels of tiredness against objective measures\nof fitness. For example, Jakob&#39;s thighs were &quot;feelin&#39; fine&quot; because he rides his\nbike a lot. But the downhill muscles were untrained. I lamented that my thighs\nwere &quot;not entirely okay,&quot; having withered somewhat with the predations of a long\nwinter. A long cheesecake winter, true, but anyway, where was I?</p>\n<p>I evolved a plan to pound my thighs by riding the bike 15 minutes, running for\n45 minutes to an hour, then biking hard for 30 minutes more. That way, I&#39;d get\nthe efficient cardiovascular workout I sought with running, and then I&#39;d render\nmy thighs into a phalanx of knotted muscle with the bike!</p>\n<p>Temporarily lost in this vision of pumping thighs, I didn&#39;t notice until it was\ntoo late that we&#39;d wandered into a zombie trap. Here we were, in the cloud\nforest on a steep and lonely ridge, now surrounded by a welter of aluminum cans\nhanging from strings, one of which I&#39;d just bashed into.</p>\n<p>Jakob&#39;s eyes swirled with complex emotions, and a low moan seemed to rise from\nbelow us in the forest. But then we decided it must have been foolish\nkids. Hpmf. We weren&#39;t going to die. Naturally we moved on to discuss our\nfavorite zombie movies, of which we had many.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/17132551497'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7705/17132551497_9a5d7cb7d3_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the ground</p>\n<p>This kept us busy until we saw the summit bald poking above. A thrilling final\nascent, and we were on top. The clouds relented somewhat and we could see across\nthe valley to the Zillertal Alps, still deep in snow. We abandoned this crowded\nsummit for a kind of duplicate or prototype summit nearby. The rain started up\nagain, and our chosen sitting-bench was covered in rank puddles! What to do!\nHere, Jakob remembered he had a towel. &quot;Well deploy it then, it is precisely the\nright moment!&quot; I boomed. To prevent further outbursts he complied and wow, it\nwas amazing what joy a dry bench to sit on brought us both. With our umbrellas\nagainst the now southwesterly lashing of the rain, we had a few minutes of\npleasure wrung from wet mountains on the Voldöpper Spitze. This gave us another\n925 meters of elevation gain, which put us at a total of 1830.</p>\n<p>A third hike? Hardly necessary.</p>\n<p>We repaired to Munich for pizza and were joined by Kris and the boys, who had\nspent the afternoon mesmerized by ancient games like &quot;Q-bert&quot; and &quot;Crystal\nCastles&quot; in a historical video game exhibition.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jakob for a fun day out!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/17152423180'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8736/17152423180_ebc87e9925_b.jpg'></a>\nHeading down</p>\n"}
