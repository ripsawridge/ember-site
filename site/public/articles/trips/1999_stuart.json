Eventually, we couldn&#39;t see the mountain at all.\"></p>\n<p>Could it be?</p>\n<p> I struggled to clamber over a jumble of boulders almost \nafraid of what I would see beyond. The rope prevented me from going\nany further without great effort, having snaked over and between\nrocks beneath me. I let myself believe the good news as I searched\nfor a place to belay \nSteve up from. The light was going fast, but\nI could watch the darkening valley with something like triumph.\nThe hours of perpetual uncertainty had taken their toll, and it\nseemed a great weight was lifted: we were at the top! At the top of\nMt. Stuart after a long and difficult day. Darkness was here, we\nwould not make it down, but we had made it up, and going down was\neasy via the Cascadian Colouir, down the gentle side of the mountain.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/stevest.jpg\" alt=\"Steve on the summit of Mt. Stuart.\">\n<img src=\"images/ingalls.jpg\" alt=\"A great view of Ingalls Peak, on the right. Our climbing route followed the left skyline.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/smingall.jpg\" alt=\"Looking down on still-frozen Ingalls Lake from the summit of Ingalls Peak.\"></p>\n<p>Steve arrived, jangling with the paltry protection I had placed in the rock, his\nnerves equally frazzled. The final steps to the summit, suffused with\nmeaning. Tired limbs, standing on rare flat earth, and the last golden rays of\nsun. Steve and I both impressed by how much the climb had asked of us. Darkness\ncrept forward, and warm red and orange faded to cool blue and purple.  Night\ncaught us just below the summit, scrambling between blocks and squinting at\nlonely Cairns, which kept us on the easiest path.  Wordlessly, we each began\nsearching for a hole or cave to block the wind that might come to steal our\nwarmth. Steve found the best spot - a nook which we eyed distrustfully, knowing\nhow long we would live there, how long each minute of an unprotected, unplanned\nbivouac at 9000 feet might last.</p>\n<p>But the weather was in our favor, with clear skies and only a light\nwind. Soon we were settled in, drinking a little water and listening\nto my noisy &quot;space blanket&quot; as it tore itself to pieces during the\nfirst hours. The events of the previous two days were recalled and\ndiscussed...</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/dercamp.jpg\" alt=\"I&#39;m playing the role of Kamp Kurmugeon, giving the evening salute to Oh-wa-nee.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/stterrn.jpg\" alt=\"Clean granite rock, leading to the summit.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/stsummit.jpg\" alt=\"This is the view looking down from the summit on the West Ridge. We came up the snowy notch between the two towers.\"></p>\n<p>A chill wind\ngreeted us at the trailhead and we didn&#39;t warm up until\nwalking a ways and grumbling suitably about the heavy packs. We would\ntake this trail to Ingalls Pass, and climb Ingalls Peak via the South\nRidge that afternoon. As we looked forward to this we admired Esmeralda\nPeak across the valley and planned a future exploration of it&#39;s\nsomewhat brushy cliffs. We passed two women and a baby out for his\nfirst visit to Ingalls Lake. Then we met Gerrod, who was thinking of\nclimbing the West Ridge of Stuart himself. The three of us continued\nup from the trees and traversed a long, hot distance until reaching\ncontinual snow just below the pass. Finally, we got our first glimpse\nof Stuart at the pass, and it was impressive! Stained black rock,\ninnumerable towers and ridges, and clouds whisking by at mid-height\nin the strong wind. Gerrod decided to visit Ingalls Peak with us,\nso we dropped our packs at a suitable place and headed straight up\na gentle colouir to the base of the route.</p>\n<p>We were protected by the &quot;Dogtooth Crags&quot; which blocked the bitter\nwind, but could see that one pitch up was a completely different world.\nA pair of climbers were descending the route by rappel, and they kept\ndisappearing behind white threads of cloud. A party of three from\nPennsylvania started the route, and we continued up after. Gerrod\nsoloed the first pitch, intending to solo the whole thing. We started\nto, but near the top of the easy first pitch was some unnerving\nmarbled rock, as slippery as ice. We descended a little and Steve\nled this section. It took some getting used to, but there were good\nfoot jams and we learned to recognize the slippery stuff.</p>\n<p>Now out of the protection of the Dogtooth Crags, we zipped up our\njackets, and Steve led up and right to a chockstone on the ridge.\nHe down-climbed a little to place the belay at the center of the\nridge. I cleaned the one or two pieces of protection, and met\nhim at the top of the second pitch. The Pennsylvania party had\nleft one member huddled below, and Gerrod had joined their rope.\nThey were rappelling down as I started the third pitch. Not\nentirely sure of the way, I climbed a blocky section on the left\nside of the ridge, then traversed right to join a central crack\nthat led up to the bolted belay station. This climbing was fun,\nwith more slippery marble - balance and friction moves. I shared\nthe belay with the descending party, everyone assuring us that\nSteve and I couldn&#39;t descend the route with our single 50 meter\nrope. They zipped down on a double rope rappel as I brought Steve\nup, and offered us the chance to rappel with them. We talked it\nover, and decided to continue on.</p>\n<p>Steve took off from the fantastically exposed belay stance, finding\nhis way quickly to the final station. The weather was getting worse.\nNow Stuart was permanently hidden behind clouds, and I was hunched\nunder my hood, paying out rope. Happy to be moving, I climbed\nquickly and met Steve in an even more miserable location, directly\nexposed to the fast, fast wind! From his excellent vantage point,\nyou could see clouds whipping across the valley like a time-lapse\nphotograph. We untied from the rope, and scrambled on easy ground\nto the summit. We lingered there as long as possible, enjoying the\nmoments of sun, and savoring the view of Ingalls Lake, still snow-covered\nbut with patches of brilliant blue. Mt. Stuart had become a ghostly\nFrankenstein castle, black and shrouded.</p>\n<p>The first rappel went perfectly, but the second wouldn&#39;t get us to\nthe top of the 2nd pitch. Luckily, Steve&#39;s reconnaissance on the right\nside of the ridge revealed that by rappelling to the chockstone\nthere, some easy down-climbing could get us down to the top of the\nfirst pitch. There was an intermediate anchor before this, a truly\nfrightening one. Someone had threaded a sling behind a loose\ncobble of rocks and called it good enough to rappel on. We\npreferred to down-climb, and this worked very well. One final\nrappel and a bit more down-climbing got us to the base.</p>\n<p>We had some cause to worry though. We&#39;d passed a party going up and\noff route. They wore shorts and t-shirts and were jumping up and\ndown at the belay station to stay warm. They were going to belay\nfrom the pitiful rock cobble, and I was able to tell them to keep\ngoing to the bolts above. As we descended the snow, Steve saw\ntheir girlfriends huddled for warmth near the base of the route.\nThey also wore shorts. Going down we worried about this party, and\nwatched for them to descend from our camp in the basin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/sumshadow.jpg\" alt=\"This shadow took us by surprise as we stood on the summit. We couldn&#39;t believe how symmetrical it was.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/sundowns.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise from the false summit of Mt. Stuart.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/stwhole.jpg\" alt=\"The red line shows our route.\"></p>\n<p>It was starting to look like winter, so we gave up on Stuart. The\nWest Ridge was fully exposed to the incredible wind, and we felt\nit would be foolish to go up in those conditions. So our camp was far\nfrom the mountain, and we decided to spend Sunday exploring and \nbouldering on the many excellent orange granite rocks. Steve was\nfascinated by this rock, it looks crumbly, but is really solid.</p>\n<p>We had couscous for dinner, very much livened up by the addition\nof Swiss cheese. We nearly came to blows trading the pot back and\nforth - never had we so relished a mountain meal!</p>\n<p>A quart of hot chocolate to sip through the night, and we fell asleep,\nlistening to the wind shake the trees above.</p>\n<p>Well, Murphy&#39;s Law got us! Morning was sunny, clear and hot. How could\nthe weather change so quickly?!? Pretty disgusted about it, we decided\nto go have a look at the base of the route, and come back in August.\nWe packed as if for the climb though, bringing rope and other gear.\nThe evening before, we had walked from camp to Ingalls Lake, impressed\nby how far away from it we were. It seemed easiest to bomb down\ninto the valley and up the other side to reach the base of the route,\na long snow colouir that led up to broken rock. Well, this was the harder\nway! Crashing through the brush, and rounding corner after corner, we\ncrossed the Ingalls Creek trail, 1000 feet down from our camp. We\nslowly regained this elevation, feeling strangely weak and tired.\nPausing to drink water, our spirits improved and we enjoyed the\nnew alpine scenery of rock, snow and the occasional shrub-like tree.\nA sharp whistle warned us to go no further, but we didn&#39;t heed it.\nReaching the steep and hard snow of the colouir, an excitement grew\nas we put on crampons. Suddenly in a hurry (just to see the base of\nthe route, of course!), I followed Steve up the steepening snow.\nIt got to about 55 degrees and we switched to our specialized techniques.\nSteve did a &quot;crabwalk,&quot; moving almost backwards up the slope, and\nI switched from a duckwalk to French technique with the occasional\nfront-pointed foot, crampon spikes biting just enough to hold the\nslope. Finally we reached the end of the snow, and admitted that we\nwere climbing the route.</p>\n<p>We filled the water bottles at a little seep, and changed to rock\nshoes. As I usually do, I whined about the now-heavy pack with boots,\ncrampons, water, and all the other essentials in it. Steve is much\nbetter about this, and a model for me to emulate (<em>I&#39;m working\non it!</em>).</p>\n<p>But now we had a delightful morning, bouldering with incredible\nexposure below. Time sped by and we each reveled in the joy of\nclimbing, twisting this way, counterbalance and friction. We\nran out of words to shout about the wildness, fun and sun!\nIntermissions came when we delicately stepped up moats between\nsnow and rock, trying to keep the sticky rubber shoes dry.\nThe mountain broke up into a bewildering array of craggy towers\nand ridges, and the valley grew more pastoral as we saw it through\na narrowing chasm. Being pasted on the middle of a big mountain\nwas such a grand experience! We were happy we committed to it.</p>\n<p>Now choosing the proper way became a top priority. Beckey&#39;s book\ndid a good job of directing us, but there were many occasions when\nwe searched for a boot print, or a section of rock with lichen\nscraped off by many hands and feet.</p>\n<p>Reaching the ridge top, we looked down the other side, then traversed\nan easy path towards the true peak. The West Tower loomed very\nfar away, and we would have to pass under it. Finally we came to\na landmark - Long John Tower, and the climb we would have to make\nup it&#39;s left side looked very steep. It was blocked by a gully\nfilled with snow, but we found a way above the snow for the most\npart. At the base of the tower, we roped up and Steve took the lead.\nRight from the start, it was tricky, with a delicate traverse under\nan overhang of black rock. Steve crabbed upward, his backpack doing\nit&#39;s best to send him off balance. He disappeared around a corner and\nI heard nothing for a long time. Finally, the rope came tight, and\nI followed, happy we had come so far without using the rope at all.\nOur elevation was 8200 feet or so, and we felt pretty close to the\n9415 foot summit. </p>\n<p>At the top of the tower, we unroped again, and\ndiscussed the way across to our next objective, the West Ridge Notch.\nIt looked\nlike many parties had gone down a ways on a series of sandy ledges.\nBut a way across was blocked by very steep hard snow. We still had\nto cross this snow, but we did it higher up, where the ribbon\nwas thinner. Changing back into boots and crampons, Steve patiently\nkicked steps into the snow wall. He declared it &quot;grim duty,&quot; occasionally\nblowing on his free hand to warm it. It was grim, because the drop\nbelow his feet was very great. I followed, and kicked up\nan easier slope that took us back to rock.</p>\n<p>We kept the boots on and wound our way between towers, in one place\nfinding an amazing little tunnel marked by a cairn. &quot;At least we&#39;re\nstill on route!&quot; I left my pack at the entrance to the tunnel,\nlowered myself into the dark cavern, and Steve lowered the pack\nto me on a sling. We repeated the procedure for him, and emerged\non a ledge where we continued the traverse to the Notch. Here\nwe split up. I down-climbed a very loose and scary gully to a\nsidewalk leading to the Notch. Steve stayed higher and found\nbetter rock.</p>\n<p>We changed back to rock shoes as afternoon sun turned to early evening\nsun. We were sure we wouldn&#39;t make it back to camp, but we still\nhoped to reach the trees, which was almost as good. Steve put me\non belay, and I swung out onto the north side of the mountain, with\na grand view of glaciers below. What a contrast with the baked, dry\nsouth side! All was cool stone, shadow, snow and ice. I placed a\nnut, then clipped an ancient iron piton as I willed my tiring body\nup to a small notch right on the ridge crest. From here, I belayed\nSteve up. I took another lead almost straight up, although the\nbook describes a traverse, keeping low. We couldn&#39;t find it.</p>\n<p>I ended up at an obvious belay/rappel station with no idea how to\ncontinue. Steve came up and we discussed our options over water and\nKris&#39;s &quot;Signature&quot; gorp. Steve climbed out on the ridge crest, but\ncouldn&#39;t see a safe way around a bulky tower. He down-climbed to a\nlong ledge, eyeing a steep crack ahead with pitons and a leftover\ncarabiner. I rappelled down to here, cursing the waning light, and\nwondering how we got off track.</p>\n<p>We were tired, and unable to see a way up from the ledge. The crack\nseemed to be our best bet, but it looked really hard. Steve got up\nthere, and rigged an aid sling to a piton. The walls were holdless\nbut he kept trying. Finally, Steve started cursing (I&#39;d never heard\nhim curse), a bad sign. </p>\n<p>Moments later, &quot;<em>Falling!</em>&quot; and I saw the flash of a helmet\nand outstretched arms, then he was out of sight again. I barely felt\na pull on the rope. &quot;Steve! Steve! Are you okay!?&quot; The \nincredibly vulnerability of our situation seemed magnified 1000\ntimes. After an eternity he answered. &quot;I&#39;m okay, I&#39;m fine.&quot; He\nsounded pretty shaky, but he checked thoroughly for blood, and \neased his weight onto the rope.</p>\n<p>There was no time to get details of the accident. I lowered him off\nthe fixed pin, and while he dealt with the shock I had another look\naround the corner. I couldn&#39;t believe that what he had attempted\nwas the route, <em>it wasn&#39;t supposed to be that hard!</em> It\nwas getting dark, and time was running out. I saw a way up, though\nthere was no sign that it was the right way. But based on what had\noccurred I decided to trust what I could climb as opposed to what\nsigns climbers had left before. In moments I was off, climbing hard\nand fast but not too fast. I had to remind myself not to let the\nfall affect how I climbed, because I was inclined to be reckless and\nmove frantically. The mental game worked and I grew calmer.</p>\n<p>I followed my nose, and 50 feet up was rewarded with a piton. I \ntiptoed up between two blocks, facing a sketchy traverse to the\nright under an overhang. The heavy rope drag convinced me to wait\nand find a belay spot. Steve came up, and sent me off again.\nI did the traverse, then the climbing soon became scrambling. With\ngreat relief and happiness, I saw the summit was just above and\nsat down happily to bring Steve up.</p>\n<p>During the long, cold night\nwe discussed down to the position of\neach hand and foot what had happened below. Steve&#39;s aid sling was\nhanging in a very wide crack from the piton, and as he strained\nfor a hold off to the side, the sling cantilevered his feet into the\ncrack, sending him into a fall nearly upside down. He struck a\nledge with his pack, which completely protected him, and didn&#39;t\nfall any further because a foot was lodged in the aid sling \n(amazingly unhurt...I couldn&#39;t believe there wasn&#39;t at least a\nsprained ankle). It was about a 10-foot fall.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we felt grateful to the mountain, for sparing us injuries\nand to the weather for remaining calm. We watched the moon arc\nacross the sky, standing at attention at the apex, which was right\nover ghostly Mt. Rainier in the distance. As it began to descend,\nwe began talking of the descent, now assured that it would happen!</p>\n<p>I shared some &quot;fruit leather&quot; (fruit roll ups) with Steve, and was\nso glad I did! He loved this stuff, making a mouthful last for 10\nminutes. This made me think of Kris and how thoughtfully she had\npicked this snack out as something new to try. I couldn&#39;t wait to\nsee her again! We sat on our packs, huddled for warmth, and talked\nabout how crazy this whole thing was...</p>\n<p>Happy to be moving, we followed more Cairns, nearly taking a wrong\nturn down Ulrich&#39;s Colouir when we missed a clever side way through\nanother rock tunnel. This took us around and to a cliff looking\ndown on the \nCascadian Colouir, and craggy Sherpa Peak, just beginning\nto get warm rays of sun. We climbed up a bit, stepping onto steep\nsnow we&#39;d have to descend for 300 feet to rocks below. We tested\nthe snow, thinking we might want to wait until it softened, but\nfinally we decided to go down. We made use of the deep plunge\nsteps others had made in the afternoon. </p>\n<p>After this, a long steep rocky trail, then more endless snow, and\nwe found ourselves back in the world of trees, babbling brooks and\nbirds. The trail was clever, but easily lost. Finally, 500 feet\nof cliffs separated us from easier terrain below and we lost the\ntrail. Gamely, we traversed into the next valley over, happy\nto see an ocean of trees and brush. </p>\n<p>But even this was hard, and constantly threw up new challenges.\nThorns, deep brush, and then the mosquitoes that kept us moving.\nI remember a haze of lowering down steep slopes hand over hand\non slide alder bushes, crashing into forest, then back to the\nslide alder. We were just creeping down, earning every 10 feet,\namazed at how the ordeal just wouldn&#39;t end! </p>\n<p>Eventually, very weary, we reached the Ingalls Creek trail at\n4000 feet. Happy\nto have put an end to uncertainty, we began the 4-mile trudge to\ncamp. We had come up one side of the mountain and descended the other,\nso the walk was long. We moved pretty slowly, joking about our \n&quot;old man&quot; speed. At the end of the trail, we climbed snow to\nIngalls Lake, then wearily continued to camp, finding it intact\nand heavenly. Steve filled our water bottles, and we settled in\nfor an hour nap in the luxurious bivy sacks we hadn&#39;t seen for\nso long. <em>Ah, the joy of a sleeping bag!</em>\nWe ate a little, and packed slowly. The 4 miles and 3000 feet to\ndrop to the car seemed to take forever, but I had a certain peace,\nand my mind was still. We only stopped once, and briefly, to\ndrink water and take off our boots. Reaching sanctuary, we sped\naway, looking back with pride at the mountain that had taken\neverything we had.</p>\n"}
