We knew it would\nstart raining eventually, hence the laziness! Right away, we climbed the\nStaffelstein Westkante (V-), which gave 2 nice pitches and some change.\nThen the route Ulknudel (VI) which had a pretty darned hard first pitch!\nI had to rest a couple of times on the sustained sport climb, but I particularly\nenjoyed an outrageous move at a roof where you get a foot up by your head.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750814468/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2106/5750814468_f6a40c0498.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750272631/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/5750272631_733f40d8da.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Next we did the Kampenwand Traverse. First I tried taking the most adventurous\nway on steep slabs, then eventually getting into a corner with a hard move\nby a piton. I had to aid on the pin! Uli came up and we simul-climbed over\na summit. Later we had a nice climb of the Gmelchturm Westkante (VI-) as\na nice little part of the traverse. Well protected climb to the top of\na tiny tower. We finished the traverse with a couple more interesting pitches,\nespecially a crack (IV+) leading up to the main summit. It was quite interesting,\nthough just a bit wet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750274425/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5144/5750274425_b6607a8445.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750274895/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5750274895_2126d6dfda.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>After this we hiked down to the south and got on the SÃ¼dostwand (VI).\nUli led the first (crux) pitch, then we had an embarrassing communication\nmishap that need not be recorded here! However eventually I followed the\npitch, and we went for one more pitch up a slab and across a slabby traverse.\nFrom here, our time was up, as the storm clouds that had been gathering\nwere ready to burst. We made two rappels to the ground, and hiked out in\nstrong rain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750821780/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2447/5750821780_65db11f76c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5750823654/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/5750823654_8c7772d1a9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We visited a hut along the way for a beer, then hiked down to the car.\nA nice visit to a new area for us both!</p>\n<p>Also wrote about it <a href=\"http://www.bergundsteigen.de/forum/viewtopic.php?id=4128\">here</a>,\nand the flickr gallery is <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157626786520884/with/5750813620/\">here</a>.</p>\n"}
