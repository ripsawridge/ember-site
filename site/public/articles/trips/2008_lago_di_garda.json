We stayed at a campground right on the beach in <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=riva+del+garda,+italy&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=45.880927,10.872688&amp;spn=0.121892,0.276375&amp;t=h&amp;z=12&amp;g=riva+del+garda,+italy\">Riva di Garda</a> (click\non the link to visit a map to show you where this is exactly). The Lago\ndi Garda is a huge lake on the edge of the Alps. It&#39;s far enough south,\nand low enough that it has a warmer climate, which is perfect for fall\nand spring when the northern alps are wet. The drive is about 3.5 hours\nfrom Munich.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2962777729/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/2962777729_cc1e4bcf64.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2962776753/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3196/2962776753_4c5b549510.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2963624284/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3190/2963624284_13af7eb50d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We thought the boys would be scared to sleep in their own tent but they\nloved it. Every night we&#39;d walk along the beach in the moonlight. In the\nday we&#39;d get gelato, which is this amazing Italian version of ice cream.\nWe&#39;d ride a ferry to another town, or go for a drive up the mountain. The\nboys loved climbing up the town tower, or one day, when we went to Arco,\nthey walked steeply uphill with me for 20 minutes to the castle above the\ntown. I&#39;m really impressed with them!</p>\n<p>Later we visited our friend Daniel and his family in Bolzano. They took\nus out for Pizza, and we had a great time catching up with them. I&#39;m amazed\nby Daniel&#39;s bike racing schedule. He has raced up the steepest passes in\nthe Alps.</p>\n<p>I did one unusual thing, climbing the <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/85571065@N00/35082003/\">Via Ferrata d&#39;Amicizia</a> in\nthe moonlight one evening. It was fantastic climbing ladders up vertical\ncliffs with the lake and town far below, all bathed in blue moonlight.\nI reached the summit at midnight, and came down a different way that led\nme to a sort of shrine in the middle of the cliff face. The townspeople\nbuilt this chapel to the virgin sometime in the 40s or 50s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2963632740/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3206/2963632740_253d99ea57.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2963629506/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3191/2963629506_1d06db62b2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We got climbing harness for Elijah and Rowan too. Climbing and camping,\nhere we come!</p>\n"}
