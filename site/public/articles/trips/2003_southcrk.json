{"date":"2003-6-22","title":"Stately Pleasure Dome South Crack","description":"<p><h2>South Crack, Grade II, 5.8 R</h2></p>\n<h3>June 22, 2003</h3>\n\n<p><em>back to <a href=\"cali.html\">Sierras</a>...</em></p>\n<p>Well, it was our last day for climbing, sigh. We&#39;d had such a great time.\nSouth Crack is a classic, awesome route with some great 5.8 finger cracks.\nHere are notes from our journal:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Pitch</td>\n<td><b>Leader</td>\n<td><b>Length</td>\n<td><b>Description</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Michael</td>\n<td>40 m</td>\n<td>\nFun flake grabbing led to a delicate traverse to a wide crack, made easier\nby a flake in the back. The crack narrowed to finger-width, occasionally\npinching off to nothing (5.8). Sustained, great climbing here!\nSemi-hanging belay from a cam, nut and piton.\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Aidan</td>\n<td>25 m</td>\n<td>\nBeautiful finger pinches! As I climbed <i>I let the world know how awesome\nthey were!</i> Stopped halfway up at nice ledge because a slow party in\nfront blocked the way. Michael and I took a long nap on seperate ledges\nwhile we waited, then I belayed him to my ledge. (5.8)\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Aidan</td>\n<td>25 m</td>\n<td>\nLed the rest of the crack to the start of slab! Looked like runout climbing\nabove...It was!\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Michael</td>\n<td>50 m</td>\n<td>\nGot two pieces of gear in the right trending crack, then set off left for\nunprotected 5.6 friction. A good cam placement was the only protection for\n25 feet of 5.7 slab climbing to a gear belay atop flakes. Exciting pitch!\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Aidan</td>\n<td>50 m</td>\n<td>Led easy runout slabs to bolts. One piece on entire pitch. (5.4)\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Michael</td>\n<td>45 m</td>\n<td>\nStraight up on easy slab then crack climbing to ledge belay that marked\nend of climb (5.5). Traverse left to descent route.\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</table>\n\n\n<p>Again we hiked down 3rd/4th class slabs like our previous trip to\nStately Pleasure. This is another great climb with a great partner!</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/aonsouthc.jpg\"><img src=\"images/aonsouthc.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on pitch 2</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/scrackp1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/scrackp1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>First pitch with a party above</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/aonsouthc1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/aonsouthc1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Another shot of Aidan on pitch 2</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/southcrack.jpg\"><img src=\"images/southcrack.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Clowning around</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/tohalfdome.jpg\"><img src=\"images/tohalfdome.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on top</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/yadome.jpg\"><img src=\"images/yadome.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>A world of domes from near the summit</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/aidannlake.jpg\"><img src=\"images/aidannlake.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan descending from Stately Pleasure Dome</i></p>\n"}
