{"date":"2011-2-5","title":"Jochberg Right Gully (WI3)","description":"<p>Christian and I climbed the Jochberg Right Gully (WI3), an entertaining\nset of N pitches (N=6? something like that), on a mountain I&#39;d wanted to\nexplore for a while. We soloed up the first steps, then used about 25 meters\nof the rope to belay sections, and also travel in coils for the bits of\nwalking in between ice steps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5422296744/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5091/5422296744_4cb2340f0a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5422297668/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5015/5422297668_f7b0c37d9b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421692329/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5421692329_dace54b2cd.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5422299656/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5176/5422299656_a88d1a6776.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Near the end was a long section of climbing up a 30 degree snow couloir\nwith interesting rock walls. Then an interesting &quot;mixed&quot; step on ice and\nrock to get above it. Finally, the climb ended with some more mixed moves,\nincluding fun frozen mud hummocks to reach the ridge crest. I dropped my\npack here and we made the hike up to the summit in brilliant sunshine.\nThe views south into the Karwendel were great.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421694317/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5296/5421694317_694d2b962c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421695267/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5421695267_3d7fc352e9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421696347/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5218/5421696347_a3de38bbb6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5422303382/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5422303382_14f36abfd1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421698477/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5219/5421698477_8b505b7643.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The hike down was extremely icy, but we suffered only a few prattfalls.\nThanks for a great time, Christian!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5421700453/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5421700453_57c1c26b1b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5425132590/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5093/5425132590_6fc71fc058.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"}
