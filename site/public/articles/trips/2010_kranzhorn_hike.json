It was really fun to have Danno join us! We had a great time on\nthe hike to the summit, then enjoyed hanging around the hut a while on\nthe way down. Thanks to Danno for joining!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175796018/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5175796018_653f3e4ef7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175794730/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5175794730_afa93fdda6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175188613/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5175188613_1f9d5b5ced.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175793280/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5175793280_a95aa78bb2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175792322/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5175792322_ea449f70b1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5175791748/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5175791748_12b50f87bf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"}
