{"date":"2011-1-1","title":"New Year's Stubai Skiing","description":"<p><strong>Zwieselbacher Rosskogel</strong></p>\n<p>Eight o&#39;clock on New Year&#39;s morning, I was alone in the parking lot, getting\nready. A man shoveled snow at a nearby inn and watched me from across a\nsnowbank. I had 2 pairs of gloves, a wind jacket, two fleece layers, and\nthe warm hat Kris made for me. I had a shovel, an avalanche beacon with\nfresh batteries, and an avalanche probe. A map, a cell phone, some goggles,\na camera, a hot thermos of tea, some cookies and an iPod with the riveting\naudiobook &quot;Unbroken.&quot;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5316589295/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5316589295_da5f329617.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5317186144/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5317186144_b383c9eba3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5316592403/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5316592403_fca685e9e0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Skins on skis, then I left, into a cold blue valley. It hadn&#39;t snowed\nin a while, and this was &quot;the most popular ski tour in Tyrol,&quot; according\nto my guidebook, so there was a good track to follow. I&#39;d been here two\nyears before with Daniel A., but we turned around because of unstable snow\nslabs that made us nervous. There shouldn&#39;t be any problem today.</p>\n<p>For a long time I was lost in thought with the story I was listening to.\nLouie Zamperini competed in the 1936 Olympics, survived deadly bombing\nmissions in the Pacific, survived for more than 30 days in an inflatable\nraft with no food, drifting over 2000 miles, only to become a Japanese\nprisoner of war. I couldn&#39;t believe the hardships endured or the determination\nto overcome.</p>\n<p>Conditions were much better than when Daniel and I were here before. I\nentered an exciting upland plateau, with a frozen lake below on my right.\nOne more plateau lay above the Kraspesferner Glacier, which I dutifully\nswitchbacked up. Finally I was in the sun! It was time to take pictures,\nbut to my sadness I realized that both batteries were nearly dead, partially\nbecause of the cold. I managed to snap a few. For the summit my trusty\niPod Nano&#39;s video camera came into service. It&#39;s not a great shot, but\nit conveys some of the wild winter in the Stubai. It was a rare pleasure\nto be complately alone.</p>\n<p>I started down, skiing cautiously as it&#39;s the first time since last year.\nThat always bugs me that the first time I ski in a year is high on a wilderness\nmountain, when the consequences of an accident are highly unpleasant! Maybe\nI should become mature and visit a ski area once first!</p>\n<p>But the skiing wasn&#39;t hard, and before I knew it I was sliding down the\nKraspes Glacier, and seeing people. 4 or 5 late risers were coming up.\nOne man decided not to go to the summit, and started down, skiing very\nwell. Where the slope flattened he lost his bearing in the deep snow and\ncrashed spectacularly! He was laughing so I, the single member of the audience,\nwhooped and clapped.</p>\n<p>Later, I think I crashed in the same place.</p>\n<p>I skied further, resorting to &quot;side-slipping&quot; a steep slope above a raging\ncreek because I didn&#39;t like the possibility of falling there. It looked\nlike others had done the same, as the fresh powder snow was mostly scrubbed\naway, leaving hard snow with a few twigs sticking out. Faint humps showed\nwhere a few brave souls made turns.</p>\n<p>&quot;That was fun!&quot; I said to no one in particular, back at the car. I drove\na few minutes down to Gries im Sellrain and found a room plus breakfast.\nI spent some time making the room homey, took a nap, then went out to dinner.\nI had two non-alcoholic beers (weird, I know), and the menu of the night,\nwhich was a pork steak with pasta and cheese. All I&#39;d eaten during the\nday was a few cookies, so I planned to order a big dessert but I was too\nfull. I&#39;d been to this restaurant before, with Josef who is a vegetarian.\nI remember he had a terrible time trying to cobble together a meatless\ndinner. Looking at the menu now though, I noticed there was an actually\nvegetarian section...so next time would be easier!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5317188416/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5289/5317188416_dbd2efba15.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5317189454/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5124/5317189454_bda27a62b4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5319408356/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5319408356_bd731ea61a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>After dinner I walked through the cemetary, which was lit up with little\nred lamps on most of the graves. The hulking mountains around were only\nsensed by the absence of stars in blackened regions of the sky. After some\nmore walking, I turned in.</p>\n<p>Sunday dawned rather grey. I&#39;d awakened a few times at night to make notes\non a horrific story idea called &quot;Tea Party Nation.&quot; :D. I had all these\narchetypes, like The Judge, the Welfare Queen, the Pundit, and how they\nwould fare under a massive political change in the U.S.. Often not how\nyou&#39;d expect.</p>\n<p>At breakfast I talked with a couple, and they recognized me from my car!\nThe husband had seen my car parked in the Munich climbing gym several times.\nSo we started talking about climbing. He told me two stories of the great\nHermann Buhl, widely considered the greatest climber of all time in Tyrol.\nOne, that he worked at the big Schuschter outdoor store in Munich during\nthe 1950s, occasionally swiping gear. But everyone loved him so they didn&#39;t\nmind. Herr Schuschter used his considerable funds to make sure Hermann\ngot on the Nanga Parbat expedition that would make him famous. He threatened\nto withhold funds and gear, making the expedition pay full price for it\nall if Hermann didn&#39;t go. Of course, we know it was the first ascent of\nan 8000&#39;er without oxygen. Solo, and with an exposed bivouac above 8000\nmeters.</p>\n<p>I told the man that my favorite Buhl story was when he rode his bike from\nInnsbruck to Piz Badille, soloed the North Face (a 5.10 rock route in modern\nterms, but much snowier/icier in the past), then rode home. We talked more\nabout climbing and said goodbye.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later I was in Luesens, getting ready to ski amid a bevy\nof ice climbers. I headed up, alone again, to the slopes west of the small\ncluster of buildings that make up town. One short but steep slope seemed\nto take forever because the skin track had been blasted into oblivion by\ndescending skiers. There was a lot of traversing and trying to ascend here\nor there.</p>\n<p>Despite the great weather forecast, I entered a thick, dark cloud, and\nwas soon covered in snowflakes. I put on a jacket and kept going in the\nflat light and pea soup that made it hard to see more than a few feet.\nThis would be &quot;fun&quot; coming down! A couple of guys caught up to me while\nI drank some tea. They were from Bolzano. I asked if they knew Daniel B.,\nbut they didn&#39;t. We exchanged notes on good Dolomiti climbs. They had done\nthe Comici on the Grosse Zinne in September. The crux pitch had very, very\nsmall handholds, they said. I told them about how Jesse and I sat below\nit for an hour, with a queue of people above us not moving, and abseiled\noff. Next time then!</p>\n<p>I continued in the lead, aiming for a patch of blue sky. Visibility improved\nand I reveled in the beauty of the area. Higher, many tracks diverged to\na subsidiary summit on the right. I looked at the map and was sure the\nSchoentalspitze was on the left. Snow there was sparser, and it looked\nlike you&#39;d just have to stop skiing halfway up a broad slope because too\nmany rocks were sticking out. I cared more about the summit than skiing,\nso I headed that way, along with the others.</p>\n<p>We skinned halfway up the slope and left the skis, then continued in boots\nto the summit. This time we were barely above a boiling array of clouds,\nswirling in rough congress with the nearby peaks. The sun felt nice. It\nseems to be typical for January skiing that you only see the sun at the\nsummit, because southern slopes often don&#39;t have enough snow to make skiing\nfun. So you sneak up the mountain by wind-protected northerly slopes. A\nquick peek over a ridge gives you a bit of warm sun, then it&#39;s back to\nthe shadow.</p>\n<p>I coaxed a few pictures out of the camera, thanks to keeping the batteries\nwarm by my chest. Skiing down, I soon entered the cloud. Two guys were\nahead of me and I used them to orient myself. By keeping one of them just\nvisible, I could ski better because I could recognize the approximate angle\nof the slope. Had I been alone I would have gone very slowly indeed! There\nwas no indicator of the angle ahead of you, and it was even hard to see\ncut up tracks in the snow left by those ahead. The best sense was feel.\nI could feel the undulating layers of compact and fresh snow beneath me,\nand that way I knew I was on track. The whoosh of gravity was a warning\nto turn!</p>\n<p>Finally they skiied off to the north, a different way than the way I&#39;d\ncome. But I was stranded on a slope that dropped off into scraggly trees.\nI&#39;d missed my turn off. Rather than climb up, I tried to ski the slope.\nIt worked, mostly. Some scraping along and grabbing of little branches,\nthen I was on a road. I went northeast, to follow the two helpful skiers.\nA combination of road and skied-out slopes got me back to the village.</p>\n<p>Another great skiing day! It was snowing heavily down here, and I decided\nnot to go &quot;ice bouldering,&quot; though I did see some people on Gasthausfall\nas I drove away. I saw terrible traffic jams between Innsbruck and Woergl,\nand was happy to go the opposite way. That is, until I entered one. It\ntook about an hour to get to Kufstein, where I decided to get off and eat\ndinner.</p>\n<p>I hiked up to the fortress to get a few of the mountains around, mostly\nhidden in cloud. My mission now was to explore Kufstein to it&#39;s limit!\nI found a bunch of historical plaques and read them all! I discovered that\nuntil the 19th century riverine travel was the way to go. It took half\na day to raft from Innsbruck to Kufstein, but 5 days to go the opposite\ndirection! They had a team of draft horses on the bank to pull the boat\nupstream. Whew. Kufstein was a border town for a long time. Germans would\ncome, show their papers, and go drinking in the bars. Apparently musical\ncompetitions were a specialty. It seemed like the town spent the 18th century\nrebuilding from rubble when the Bavarians attacked in 1703. Just as they\nfinished, the Bavarians (as part of Napoleons Army) attacked again. Ey\nyi yi...</p>\n<p>The oldest record of human habitation in Tyrol was found in caves nearby.\nTools and spears, 30,000 years old. The town was a Roman garrison, and\nlater an important strategic location in the Middle Ages. It earned the\nright to build protective walls.</p>\n<p>Oh, the sewing machine was invented here.</p>\n<p>So it went on like that for hours. I found a restaruant with wi-fi, and\nwatched the enormous traffic jam slowly unlock. Finally around 7:30 the\nroads were pretty clear, and I drove home.</p>\n<p>Stats: The peaks had 1450, and 1400 meters elevation gain. I climbed them\neach in something under 4 hours, and the ski down was always quick (like\nan hour or less).</p>\n"}
