{"date":"2004-7-5","title":"Burgundy Spire","blurb":"and Paisano Pinnacle!","description":"<ul>\n<li>via Paisano Pinnacle and North Face (5.8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Robert and I engaged in a frenzy of planning, moving days here and\nthere to accomodate our voracious need to climb! We eventually ended\nup with a 1 day trip to Washington Pass to climb Paisano Pinnacle and\nBurgundy Spire. The twist was that I&#39;d leave Robert there, so he and\nJulie could go hiking the next day.</p>\n<p>We arrived and hiked steeply down to the river, crossed on a shaky\nlog, and commenced the uphill grind.  I began complaining immediately\nabout being tired from my attempted climb of Monte Cristo Peak the day\nbefore. &quot;What were you thinking?&quot; said Robert. But before long he\noffered to carry the heavy climbing gear in my pack. Although sorely\ntempted, I couldn&#39;t give in to such a display of unmanliness.  &quot;Maybe\nlater,&quot; I said.</p>\n<p>By and by, we made progress on the very steep trail, achieving\nstunning viewpoints of spires to the southwest. Mosquitoes weren&#39;t\nbothering us, which was odd considering the huge dollops of blood they\nwould extract in the evening. Some parties were coming down, one\nboasted of carrying wine, pork roast and other spirited foods up to\nthe col. &quot;Best thing we ever did,&quot; was the hoarse cry. Yet the\npermanent hunch under bulging backpacks left us dubious. Perhaps it&#39;s\nbetter to carry a bottle of wine, a sharp knife, and a leash attached\nto a lamb up there for a hideous Bacchanal!</p>\n<p>Folks were dubious of our plan to climb the two towers as a day\ntrip. But we&#39;ve learned you can always climb faster. Or rather, it&#39;s\nnot the climbing, it&#39;s the belaying that slows you down. It really\nhelps to have a &quot;Camelback&quot; too. No more excuses to stop and mop the\nsweat from your palms, pretending to fumble for water until your\npartner gets impatient enough to lead &quot;Weeping Death Pitch IV.&quot;</p>\n<p>Anyway, Robert led us to a secret stream for more water (My Camelback\nsuffers from a high leakage rate, so my backside was always nice and\ndamp). Then some more scrambling uphill brought us to the base of\nPaisano Pinnacle. We wanted to climb the West Buttress, a 5.9 (?)\nroute first climbed in 1971.  Considering that when I started\n&quot;climbing,&quot; my goal was to do climbs less than a century old, getting\nonto something from the year of my birth was pretty happy news. Aside\nfrom the moistened backside.</p>\n<p>We scrambled up to a ledge on the obvious buttress and roped\nup. Robert took off, finding tricky climbing just around the corner. I\nscrabbled up a corner crack, then began heaving on a solitary green\nbranch snaking down the cliff. In this mountain range, brush is always\nstronger than people, so my trust was unexamined. We walked up a\ngentle stretch of ridge, extensively groomed by someone with a\nhacksaw, leaving neatly trimmed gnarled shrubs to keep the path\nclear. I used the term &quot;Klettergarten,&quot; and we were off on a Deutsche\ntheme for hours. Some real climbing on clean granite took us to a\nledge below steep walls. Here we met the crux of the route: a steep\nhand crack leading to bulges and fingerlocks.  Since a few\nnon-climbers might still read this, a fingerlock is a hole in the rock\nin which your fingers can be placed semi-permanently. The object is to\nstuff enough fingers in there that they won&#39;t come out no matter\nwhat. &quot;Finger Locks or Pine Box,&quot; as Robert likes to say.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/paisano.jpg\" alt=\"Climbing on Paisano Pinnacle.\">\n<img src=\"images/onburgun.jpg\" alt=\"The view from Burgundy Spire\">\n<img src=\"images/onloose.jpg\" alt=\"A steep but loose section on Paisano Pinnacle.\">\n<img src=\"images/cedercreek.jpg\" alt=\"Kangaroo Ridge and the Cedar Creek Wall.\">\n<img src=\"images/aftertwob.jpg\" alt=\"Robert halfway up Burgundy Spire.\">\n<img src=\"images/viewwest.jpg\" alt=\"Goode, Black, and Logan Peaks. \">\n<img src=\"images/seehighway.jpg\" alt=\"The highway is far below.\">\n<img src=\"images/lastpitchwide.jpg\" alt=\"The summit ridge.\">\n<img src=\"images/robertsummit.jpg\" alt=\"Robert on the summit of Burgundy Spire.\">\n<img src=\"images/meburgo.jpg\" alt=\"Propagandizing to the masses.\"></p>\n<p>Robert led me up this pitch, then I crabbed across a wall looking for\na way up. The rock looked beautiful - too bad none of it was\nattached. I placed a lot of gear, half-expecting each nubbin to\ncollapse under my weight. Once back on the ridgecrest, the climbing\neased. Robert took off for a long simul-climbing pitch to the\nsummit. We had fun wandering along the ridge. Just below the summit\nwas a tricky face climbing move that Robert had expertly protected\nwith a steel nut in a small pocket on the slab.</p>\n<p>We hung out a few minutes, admiring my tiny car so far below (almost a\nvertical mile), and started looking at Burgundy Spire. A bit of trivia\nwe repeated often is that it&#39;s the hardest principle summit in the\nCascades to reach by any route. We climbed down easy rock from the\nsummit of Paisano and stashed our boots and other unnecessary gear at\nthe base of the first cliff. Another party, Cliff and Michael, were\njust starting up. The lower face was broad, so Robert easily found a\nvast swath of slabs and cracks we could climb far to the right of\nthem. He quickly ran the rope out and I followed for a simul-climbing\npitch through some spectacular climbing. A series of 5.8 cracks snaked\nsteeply up, accepting hands and feet for secure climbing. A good hand\ncrack is like a belay ledge, someone once said.</p>\n<p>Now on a broad bench, we followed it around to the right, going\nthrough a tunnel with snow. Cautioned to keep walking for a ways more,\nwe scrambled to a ridge crest at the end of the bench. Here we saw a\nnice hand crack above us. By now all my water had dribbled out of my\nleaky Camelback, so my skin began to &quot;paper&quot; alarmingly. Before I\nturned to dust, I scrabbled up to the hand crack, which was actually\noff route. Should you want to climb it, it is about 5.8, sustained for\n3-4 moves, and festooned with the most fascinatingly thick hunks of\nlichen you&#39;ve ever seen. This left me on the left side of the ridge\ncrest, and I was now subjected to Robert hollering about the need to\nenter the dihedral on the right.  &quot;Keep cool, my babies!&quot; I said. To\nmyself that is. Just before giving up and downclimbing I found a sly\nledge amid smooth slabs that let me traverse back to the right. Now I\nwas in the sanctioned dihedral, and enjoyed the great moderate\nclimbing up the long V for 80 feet or so.</p>\n<p>I didn&#39;t let Robert know I was belaying at a sturdy ledge, so he faced\nlicheny horrors on the hand-crack.  Always saavy, he would move the\ncam I&#39;d placed up the crack bit by bit to protect his ascent. Still, I\ncould practically hear the crunching of lichen 100 feet below. After\nadmiring the view from this great bivy ledge, we sent me off with the\n&quot;boat anchor&quot; 3.5 cam carried all this way for a supposed wide crack\npitch. First, thin face climbing moves with an occasional Pine Box\ntook me up golden rock, then I rounded a corner to find the wide\ncrack/chimney. I left the &quot;boat anchor/old maid&quot; at the base, and\nthrew myself at the crack. Wide cracks are too big for your hands and\ntoo small for your body, so you compromise by rattling your arm around\ninside. Feeling vaguely foolish, I used small features on the face to\nmove up and rattled my arm for show in the crack. Finally the siege\nwas over and I made slow-motion hero moves on a knife edge ridge\ncrest. As the music swelled I carved out my domain next to the summit\nblock, and brought Robert up from a sturdy belay anchor. Only one\nperson could sit on the true summit at a time, so we took turns\nthundering at the masses below from our bully pulpit.</p>\n<p>Robert thought we could rappel into a notch and climb to the summit of\nChianti Spire. We fixed a single line, and he rapped into the deep\nnotch. It was revealed that we&#39;d have at least 80 feet of free-hanging\nprussiking to get back up. I wasn&#39;t keen on that, having forgotten my\nprussiks and feeling dubious about executing the task with slippery\nSpectra slings. So he came back up, enjoying some 5.10 chimney\nclimbing on top-rope.</p>\n<p>We descended, getting a rope stuck on the first double rope\nrap. Robert was able to scramble up ledges 50 feet to retrieve it. We\nmade 2-3 more rappels to reach our packs, then 2 more rappels to reach\nBurgundy Col. Robert did some difficult downclimbing instead, perhaps\nimpatient with the tiresome coiling and uncoiling. At the col we ate\nsome food and said hello to a mountain goat. Soon we were bombing down\nthe scree, trying not to think about the long steep trail ahead. Late\nafternoon shadows spread from the peaks around, and soon, above us\nrather than level.</p>\n<p>After the long walk down, we found an easier log to cross the creek,\nand hiked tiredly up to the car.  I think it was 13 hours round\ntrip. A new adventure began now, because we&#39;d left the lights on and\nthe battery was dead. Great!</p>\n<p>We waited for Cliff and Michael to arrive. They were most excellent\ncompanions, sharing a beer with us, and giving us a ride to a\ncampground down the road where Robert expected Julie to arrive the\nnext morning.  I didn&#39;t have a sleeping bag, so I took a blanket Kris\nkept in the car for naps. Near the campground, we found a tow truck,\nwho promised to come back around 1 am and meet me on the road. So I\nrested by the fire Robert built for an hour or so, warm in my\nblanket. &#39;Round midnight I took myself and the blanket for a lonely\nwalk on the highway. Stopping to laze on occasion, I heard the truck\ncoming just as I was contemplating climbing down to Cutthroat Creek\nfor some water. He gave me a jump, and I was finally on my way home. I\nnapped for a few hours near Darrington, and made home at 6 am.</p>\n<p>I thought Peter might call to go climbing that morning, but I guess I\nwas lucky it rained so I could sleep in!  Thanks to Robert for a great\nclimb!</p>\n<h2 id=\"detailed-notes\">Detailed notes</h2>\n<p>Here are the pitches for Paisano Pinnacle:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Robert climbed a 5.8 pitch, 50 meters.</li>\n<li>I walked 50 meters up to a cliff</li>\n<li>I led a nice 5.6 crack up to a big ledge below a steep crack, 40 meters?</li>\n<li>Robert led the 5.9 steep crack and then fingerlocks and face climbing next to a chimney. 30 Meters.</li>\n<li>I traversed a vertical wall 5 meters, then up rotten rock to gain the ridge crest. (5.8). Good pro was found in the kitty litter. I climbed up a distance on the crest to a ledge.</li>\n<li>Robert strung two pitches together in 100 meters of simul-climbing. Exciting bit of 5.8 face climbing just below the summit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Burgundy Spire had the following pitches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Robert led a long simul-climbing pitch of 100 meters that included the 5.8 crux of the route, steller hand cracks leading to a broad bench/ledge.</li>\n<li>After walking across and down the ledge, I led up a ridge crest, getting off the standard route by following an enticing 5.8 hand crack covered in lichen. Higher up, regained the crest with a rightward traverse on a ledge, then a long fun dihedral. 50 meters.</li>\n<li>I led a 5.7 face with fingerlocks in a thin crack. Above this was a 5.7 wide crack/chimney that led to the summit ridge. 45 meters.</li>\n</ol>\n"}
