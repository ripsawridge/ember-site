{"date":"2000-9-16","title":"Del Campo Peak","blurb":"new route!","description":"<p>Mike Adamson and I hiked to Gothic Basin and scrambled up Del Campo Peak. The\nway was gloomy and foggy for miles, but we had plenty to talk about, both being\nvery enthusiastic about the cascades and future climbing ideas.  The rough trail\ncrossed waterfalls that I had last visited two years ago with my nephews Steven\nand Sam. We passed an abandoned mining structure on the mountainside, then\ncontinued up to the basin, and Foggy Lake. We couldn&#39;t see any mountains in the\nmurk and I was getting a little discouraged. If something didn&#39;t appear, we&#39;d\nhave to try and wring some pleasure out of the foggy forests. This is hard,\nbecause it usually depends on being able to name various plants, and I suck at\nthis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/wbroute.jpg\" alt=\"I drew my exciting scramble route on this fair-weather picture\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/foggylake.jpg\" alt=\"What a pretty lake!\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/routedc.jpg\" alt=\"Rough topo of the route (3 pitches, 5.0)\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/gothicba.jpg\" alt=\"Mysterious Gothic Basin\"></p>\n<p>So we climbed slopes above Foggy Lake on a nice way trail, finally\ncoming to a snowfield and hearing voices echoing eerily somewhere\nabove. Without ice axes, we didn&#39;t like the long icy traverse\ndelineated by their tracks, so we headed up and left, where other\nvoices in the murk shouted. We came to a high saddle with scrub\ntrees, and saw a great cliff, here on the north west side of Del\nCampo. Three dejected fellows sat on a rock outcropping.\n{\\em &quot;Yeah, we thought this was the way, but I&#39;m not going up that!&quot;}\nsaid one. We could see that the cloud cover ended just\nsome hundred feet above our heads - a mixture of blue and\nsteaming white. We saw that the pinnacle was drawn against a\nsharp blue sky up there. My desire for sun led me on a hunt for\nthe summit. I found\na lower angle area of the great cliff on the opposite side.\nThe rock was still steep, but with great in-cut holds. One of\nthe three decided to try a loose lower-angle gully just to my\nright. As he slipped and slid among tiny pebbles, he wisely\nbacked off. </p>\n<p>After about 100 feet, I came to a rappel/belay sling. This told\nme I was perhaps in over my head. But I was near the ridge crest,\nand thought I could follow it to the summit. I kept going,\nprotected only by the clouds that prevented me from seeing the\nfull exposure. But really, the rock was delightful! I promised\nto come back with a rope sometime and do it right. The crux\nwas edging up the side of a chock-stone to gain the ridge crest.</p>\n<p>Once there, I was above the clouds! {\\em &quot;Oh my god.&quot;} All the principal\nsummits of the region were up there too. Sloan crumbled in the sun,\nGlacier Peak, Columbia, Keyes. Interestingly, Gothic Peak was hidden, \nas it was just a little smaller than Del Campo. Even better, I had this\nmarvelous, sinewy ridge crest, and at it&#39;s end were a startled\nbunch of five looking at me wide-mouthed. &quot;How did he get there?&quot;\nI heard. Concentrating on my task, I savored the last moves, and\narrived at the summit. This delightful party of five were impressed\nby my route, and they laughed when I said I&#39;d bring a rope to\n&quot;do it right.&quot; They were a fun bunch, I got some sunscreen from them,\nended up in their group photo shots, and exchanged witty banter.\nSome of them were in the fabric business, and I learned something\nabout the production of nylon and taffeta. This was the best chance \nmeeting with like-minded strangers I&#39;d ever had on a summit.</p>\n<p>The two men and three women nimbly scrambled down, being very, very\ngood at leaving loose rocks in place. I had a little trouble keeping\nup, but learned much from their &quot;quiet&quot; loose-mountain technique. \nFor this side of the peak was piled with stones on ledges and\nfrost-fractured licheny blocks. A few scrub trees, then slabs and\nsnow, and we said goodbye. They seemed like some kind of private \n&quot;mountain goat&quot; club.</p>\n<p>Somewhat tired, we found a lot to laugh about as we invented the concept of\ngraded scrambling - ie a 4.11c or a hard 3.6 red-point.  Much riffing on the\nconcept, and sketches for films or magazines ensued. This was a great way to\npass the time, because soon we were walking the mile of road back to the truck,\nand our day of mountain fun came to an end. At the trail-head, we met a weary\nduo who had tried to climb East Wilman&#39;s Spire from the bushwhacking, west\napproach.  Been there, done that...</p>\n<p>Thanks to Mike Adamson for a fun day in the mountains!</p>\n"}
