{"date":"2008-9-19","title":"The Breittachklamm","description":"<p>During our 5 day stay in Bad Hindelang, one day was pretty cloudy. Nearby,\nthe Breittachklamm advertised itself as being perfect for a rainy day.\nIn the car, family!</p>\n<p>After 30 minutes we were there. Deep river canyon formations seem to happen\na lot in the Northern Limestone Alps (a chain roughly from Salzburg in\nthe east to the Swiss border in the west). They are called &quot;klamms&quot; in\nGerman, and for 100 years or so many of them have been developed for tourism.\nTunnels and walkways lead through the canyon, bringing you very close to\nrushing white water or ducking under rock overhangs. In the winter, dramatic\nice cliffs form in there. The mountain town of Garmisch, for example, has\ntwo famous &quot;klamms.&quot;</p>\n<p>So we thought this would be fun, but we&#39;d have to make sure the kids held\nour hands for the areas where there are big drop offs. There is a guard\nrail, but it&#39;s just kind of an advisory rail.</p>\n<p>We enjoyed it a lot. We had a little problem when Elijah put his foot\ndown and didn&#39;t want to hold hands. But he came to see reason, and we could\ncontinue. We didn&#39;t go all the way through, but I think we saw all the\nspectacularly steep and dramatic parts of the canyon. Mom has been doing\nmore walking here than in a month of Sundays, and this day was no exception!</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856172992/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3154/2856172992_ac6fed53b7_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856173576/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2253/2856173576_d8f9af389f_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856174240/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2856174240_6fe90b0b8d_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856174694/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/2856174694_73b26e00d8_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855341415/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2855341415_7a5ba92534_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856176420/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3282/2856176420_c9a4b3af3b_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The rest are <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157607284549121/\">here</a>.</p>\n"}
