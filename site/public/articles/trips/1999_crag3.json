Sloan Peak via the Corkscrew Route was our goal, but after\ntwo beautiful weather days, the clouds came rolling in as I left work\non Friday, eager to create a typical rainy, cloudy weekend. </p>\n<p>Steve made the drive up from Portland anyway (bravely!), and we drove\nout highway 2 for Castle Rock, a multipitch crag just west of Leavenworth.\nLight snow then fierce rain chased us down from the pass, things\nimproving marginally. We parked the car 1 mile east of rain casting a\njaundiced eye at the clouds above. We&#39;re going up anyway!</p>\n<p>Steve had picked a route on the Lower Castle (The Fault (5.6)) \nso we could climb rather than\nhike to Logger&#39;s Ledge, which divides the Castle in half. I got the first\npitch, an easy crack up and beyond a bush to a tree belay. On this lower\npart of the rock, many of the cracks were filled with soil, moss, grass,\nwhatever. This makes it harder to place protection as you climb, so I\nwas glad the climbing was pretty easy. I passed the tree, and went 20\nfeet higher to a comfortable ledge, and watched the Tumwater River and\ncars below. The sun peeked out occasionally.\nSteve came up and our route turned into exploration, since the guidebook\nleft the 2nd pitch with a very vague description. He ended up traversing\na grassy ledge off to the right, I followed and then belayed from a\ntree as he headed up on mossy ledges. We didn&#39;t know which way to go,\nso he had to find a route with careful advancement and occasional down-climbing.\nFinally, a good belay ledge was found, and I followed, kind of enjoying\nthe green, mossy nature of the climb. </p>\n<p>Now, at Logger&#39;s Ledge we were ready to climb the classic Midway Direct, rated\n5.6. It starts with a climb of Jello Tower, in a crack which divides the\ntower from the face of upper Castle Rock. Steve had led this before, so I\ntook the lead this time. Ancient pitons pounded into the rock by pioneers\nin the 1940&#39;s added a sense of history to the climb. I went ahead and\nattached the rope to these rusty relics, figuring that if they lasted this\nlong, they&#39;ll protect me too! I really enjoyed this climb, because it requires\nthe climber to do a little bit of everything: placing your back against a\nwall and inching upward. Twisting your upper body as you look for holds with\none foot on the tower, the other on the wall. The fun ended quickly, and I\nwas in the sun on the tower, belaying Steve up. We congratulated each other\non the adventures thus far, and Steve took the sharp end of the rope (a joke)\nfor the next lead.</p>\n<p>This pitch begins with a bang, because the climber makes an awkward step off\nof the tower, committing himself to the wall of Castle Rock. Leaving the tugboat\nfor the barge, Steve made it look easy and climbed straight up a fracture\nto an indentation he could belay me up from. But we both felt adventurous,\nand were betting that there would be something ahead, just out of sight.\nHe climbed on, receding beyond the horizon of rock above me. The wind\npicked up and the rope was running out. Finally, with no rope left, I felt\na firm tug and could give no more. Praying that he found a belay spot, I\ndis-attached myself from the tower and stepped off. Steve pulled in the slack\nso I knew I could relax that he wasn&#39;t still climbing up into space!</p>\n<p>Halfway up this enjoyable climb, I took a wrong turn, getting myself under a\nbulge of rock that couldn&#39;t be climbed (&quot;by me&quot; is implied!). I had to\nback down, but Steve had pulled me tight! Suddenly, it started raining hard,\nand the licheny rock became slippery. I was stuck until Steve got the picture\nand gave me a little rope so I could back down and come the right way.\nDue to the wind, even though he was only 35 feet above, he didn&#39;t hear\nmy bellows of rage! Once beyond that, the climbing got harder as the rock\nbecame slippery...I worried about what was ahead. Fate smiled on us, because\nSteve was at the top, with a dizzying vantage point down to the highway.\nWe looked down on his tiny car, happy that all of our upward progress came\nfrom roped climbing.</p>\n<p>We headed 5 miles east into Leavenworth, where the sun was shining. Wolfing\nsome burgers among the Winnebago set, we planned to head back west into\nIcicle Canyon for the rest of the day. Despite occasional rain, we got by\nwithout hindrance. We top-roped the &quot;Piller de Cowboy Boot&quot; and it\nrudely spit us off again and again. This feature on Trundle Dome can be\nclimbed by a hand crack which grinds skin off the climber&#39;s knuckles like\na cheese grater. We finally gave up, stomping through poison ivy to retrieve\nthe rope and find an expanse of rock more forgiving.</p>\n<p>Settling on Mountaineer&#39;s Dome, we climbed unnamed cracks for 3 pitches to \nthe top. Up to now, Steve and I had been\nvery careful about knowing exactly what was ahead on a route, but now\nwere beginning to enjoy the exploratory aspect of climbing. When the\nclimbing is well within your ability it is akin to leaving the trail,\nhunting for hidden flowerpatches or viewpoints!</p>\n<p>We hobbled down a boulder field in climbing shoes, then reached the\ncar at dark. A good meal at Gunther&#39;s recharged our batteries, and we\ndecided to drive for Vantage that night. With marginal weather here,\nwe figured that going further into the desert would give us a better\nchance for a rain-free day. By midnight, we were bivied at\nthe Vantage campground, falling asleep to visions of movement over stone,\nthe clinking of metal hardware, and wind roaring through a canyon of\ndreams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-2-vantage\">Day 2 : Vantage</h2>\n<p>Located in the Central Washington steppe, Vantage climbing is done on\nbasalt cliffs above sagebrush flats near the Columbia River. \nMiles of wavy hills and valleys provide a lonely backdrop for climbers\nworking their way up the steep walls. Intrepid climbers discovered\nthe cliffs in the 1950&#39;s, first naming Agaltha Tower, and climbing\non The Feathers. In the 1990&#39;s, Vantage became a household  when new routes on the\nSunshine Wall began attracting climbers in greater numbers.</p>\n<p>Pop tarts and water for breakfast, then a quick hike over a ridge started\nthe day. As usual, we were up before (almost) everyone else, enjoying\nthe smugness of the early riser. The trail down from the ridge to\nSunshine Wall contained the coolest (semi)-natural feature I&#39;ve ever\nseen: the trail leads to the edge of a cliff, then descends into a\ntunnel between standing columns of basalt. The width of a mobile-home\ncentral hallway, the tunnel takes you down between high walls with\noccasional &quot;windows&quot; to the expansive canyon below. There is just\nenough room for a few people going one direction, so those wanting\nto head back up have to wait for downhill hikers to emerge from the\nrabbit hole. Really neat!</p>\n<p>Steve led the classic Peaceful Warrior (5.6), the first of many entirely\nbolted routes for the day. Emboldened by the bolted protection, we\nmoved on to harder climbs, first Clip &#39;em or Skip &#39;em (5.8), which\nactually had too many bolts -- I was tiring from the effort of clipping,\nand found it easier to just keep climbing. We both enjoyed this climb,\nit goes straight up a column with numerous fragmented &quot;dinner plate&quot;\nhand and footholds.</p>\n<p>Then the crowds began to trickle through the rabbit hole, and we ended\nup down at the M &amp; M wall, attempting a climb of &quot;High Five&quot; (5.8). Steve got\nhalfway up, took a wrong turn to wavy sloping rock on the right, and\nthe next instant he was hanging from the rope 12 feet below, and I\nwas bouncing down from an impact with a small rock tower, caused by\nthe fall. We were happy that I caught him, but a little shaken by the\nevent! I had a scrape on my knee and Steve didn&#39;t even have a bruise.</p>\n<p>Okay. My turn. The climb felt &quot;haunted&quot; as I climbed up to his last\npiece of protection, and continuing on to the fall area required\nwrestling with a few inner demons. However, Bob S. taught me a\nmove last summer (&quot;the drop knee&quot;) which easily got me past the\nbulge and allowed me to finish the climb safely. Then Steve and I\nboth did the climb on top-rope, discussing the variety of techniques\ncalled for. Now, nothing motivates a climber like a climb that defeats\nhim, or makes him feel defeated. Steve is gunning for a lead of\nthis climb, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have it soon.</p>\n<p>I followed Steve back to the car for some lunch, then we did 3 short\nclimbs at the Feathers, a collection of short detached pillars.\nThey each had their charm, and by the end, we&#39;d had enough climbing.\nWe sped away on I-90 around 4, finishing the day with a crazy little\nclimb at Marymoor Park where our weary dis-organizational mishaps required\nconvoluted &quot;fixup&quot; procedures. The End.</p>\n"}
