It was great\ndriving along the east side of the mountains and trying to identify\npeaks. Dozens of police cars were speeding north. We had a P.T. Cruiser,\nwhich we hated because it was hard to see the peaks from the cramped windows.\nIn Bishop, we went to KFC for lunch, bought some food supplies and rented\na bear canister. We drove to the trailhead for Bear Creek Spire, and settled\nin after a short hike to look at the peak. We were at 10,000 feet.</p>\n<p><b>Sunday:</b>\nClimb of <a href=bearcreek.html>Bear Creek Spire</a>. We got back pretty wasted, and drove down to\nTom&#39;s Place for a great country dinner. We came back and conked out. </p>\n<p><b>Monday:</b>\nWe got up and drove north, returning the bear canister at a ranger station.\nActually, it was the Lake Mono National Monument, and they were puzzled about\nthe canister. But a phone call sorted everything out. After the spectacular\ndrive to Toulumne, we found there was only one small campground open. We\ngot one of the last places. In the late afternoon, I convinced Aidan to climb\nLembert Dome. We climbed the very nice <a href=lembert.html>Northwest Books</a> in three pitches.\nWe ate at the Toulumne Lodge, for the first of several great meals there.\nThere was a huge rainstorm that evening, fueling our concerns about the\nweather. </p>\n<p><b>Tuesday:</b>\nWe got up early and <a href=matthes.html>climbed Matthes Crest</a>.\nI&#39;ll bet we ate at Toulumne\nLodge again. I discovered the steak, man it was good! Our neighbors in\nthe campground spent the day climbing Fairview Dome. They were a great\npair of climbers from Colorado. They had a guitar I could play, and we\ntalked about all kinds of climbs and crazy situations. We were warned about\nthe mad circus of crowds on Fairview Dome, and our guidebook said people\nspend days trying to get on the climb amid the hordes. We decided to get\na late start in the morning, wandering up there around 9 or 10 am.</p>\n<p><b>Wednesday:</b>\nWe got up late and <a href=fairview.html>climbed Fairview Dome</a>.\nAfter this great experience, we\ntreated ourselves to a night in a tent cabin. We got to take a shower (first\nof the trip), call homes, and have a nice dinner with a couple who used to\nhike in Washington. We did a miserable job getting the fire going in our\ncabin, using up all the newspaper. Aidan eventually figured it out, and became\nthe fire expert for the rest of the trip. Revelling in our 2 beds each we\ncouldn&#39;t decide which one to sleep in. By candlelight, we recorded our\npitch-by-pitch descriptions of the climbs we&#39;d done so far, really enjoying\nplaying it back in our heads.</p>\n<p><b>Thursday:</b>\nToday was a long-promised rest day. Aidan was always worried about getting\nto tired to climb, or maybe feeling tired of climbing. And I was always\npooh-poohing such ideas, and pushing us to climb more. Well, I had managed to\npush the rest day out this far! Aidan, with many wistful comments and asides,\nhad made his desire to see the valley very clear. I didn&#39;t want to make the\ndrive, remembering how long it could be behind a dozen Winnibagos. But how\ncould I deny the boy? It was time to visit \n<a href=\"images/inyos.jpg\">the Valley</a>.</p>\n<p>So we did. Aidan saw my point about the long drive, but traffic did move pretty\nfast. We foolishly drove past the only gas station, and had to drive around\nthe valley on empty, wondering how we&#39;d make the 15-mile drive back to the\nstation! El Capitan was huge, of course. We stopped a few times to look around.\nSitting in El Cap Meadow was fun, watching parties high on the face. I felt\na kind of frustration to be there as a spectator. I didn&#39;t want to look at it\nbecause the inevitable desire to climb it would create stress! While I played\nthat silly game with myself, Aidan was content to be Agog. We went to Camp IV,\nand I showed Aidan where Jeff Witt and I had camped 4 years before. We\nwatched a gaggle of honed Euro-klimbers on a famous boulder problem. We\nwandered among some top-ropers. Amazingly, \n<a href=\"images/chancemeet.jpg\">Aidan ran into a friend</a> from school!\nI took their picture. \n<a href=\"images/wateroflife.jpg\">Aidan splashed in the river</a>, but \nI was content to \n<a href=\"images/dirtoflife.jpg\">paw at the soil</a>\n, paying my homage. The empty gas tank clamered for attention,\neventually leading us away.</p>\n<p>Dinner at Toulomne Lodge - try the steak! The \n<a href=\"images/tentcabin.jpg\">tent cabin</a> was nice and toasty\nwith a roaring fire.</p>\n<p><b>Friday:</b>\nAfter another freezing night (the fire always goes out and we shiver under 4 blankets), we got up pretty early to climb\n<a href=catheichorn.html>Cathedral Peak</a>.\nIt&#39;s the &quot;must do&quot;\nof the region, with a scenic approach and easy climbing on beautiful rock.\nAfter that and Eichorn Pinnacle, we hiked down and attempted to lay down\nin a meadow for a nap. Alas, the mosqitoes were intense, and we ran away.\nIt was this day or maybe the day before that the tradition of eating lunch\nat the Toulumne Grill started. They had great burgers. Aidan put on his\nbusiness management cap and saw all kinds of flaws in the operation. They\nhad many employees, but none knew what they were doing. There were numerous\nfiascos involving change, forgotten orders, giggling in the back room, and\nfailure to communicate. Aidan should have been in charge. We ran into Aidan&#39;s\nfriend Eric from Tacoma, he was a righteous fella. </p>\n<p><b>Saturday:</b>\nAidan and I both wanted to climb Mt. Conness, but it&#39;s summit was encased\nin clouds every afternoon. The SuperTopo guidebook warned about that situation \nrepeatedly, and we heeded it, having appreciated all of the other advice.\nSo instead, we climbed <a href=daff.html>West Crack on DAFF Dome</a>,\nthen climbed \n<a href=gwbooks.html>Great White Books</a>\non Stately Pleasure Dome. It was a great climbing day. I&#39;d recovered from my\nloss of confidence on Fairview Dome, running it out on the 5.8 finger\nand hand cracks, which now seemed easy but still exciting. The tent\ncabin was getting unjustifiably expensive, and we had one more night.\nWe decided to drive east for an hour and camp at one of the last sites\nbelow Dana Peak. It was kind of a dust bowl, but we still built a great fire\nand enjoyed delicious hot dogs. The good ol&#39; boys in the camp next door had\na DVD player and a wide screen TV set up. They were watching some kind\nof &quot;ultraviolence&quot; movie judging by the ragged screams that soothed me\nto sleep. </p>\n<p><b>Sunday:</b>\nWhat should we do, what should we do? After looking at Tenaya Peak, we changed\nour mind about climbing a long 5.5 route on it. There was a potentially\ntroublesome snowpatch on the slabs, and I had to agree with Aidan that a few\nsteller 5.8 pitches was better than 15-ish 5.0 ones. Especially being kind of\ntired and lazy. So we climbed \n<a href=southcrk.html>South Crack on Stately Pleasure Dome</a>. Try as I might, I couldn&#39;t get Aidan to sign up for one more climb. He laughed as I\nselectively read from the guidebook to entice him. \n&quot;There is no better spot in Tuolumne to...climb...than...Pywiack Dome&quot; I would\nsay. When he found out the line was actually &quot;to watch climbing than\nin front of Pywiack Dome&quot; he took off his harness and put it away. Sigh!\nHe gave me props though for being some kind of climbing robot. That made\nme feel happy enough that I was content to call it a day a little early.\nStill, I assert that Pywiack Dome would have been the...best...climbing...in\n...Toulumne...!</p>\n<p>We drove to a scenic overlook with a babbling brook, \nate our final burgers from the grill,\nand repacked the car for the airport. The meadow looked so beautiful. We&#39;d\ngotten to feel at home here, and felt like the place would always be\nwith us. We&#39;d had an incredible time. </p>\n<p>We drove to Reno and found a cheap motel near the airport. I think we ordered\na pizza for dinner. We took our climbing notes to a Kinkos and made little\nstapled books for ourselves with all the statistics: 55 pitches, 9 great climbs.</p>\n<p><b>Monday:</b>\nFly home. I was so eager to see Kris. Nancy was there to pick up Aidan. Constant\ncompanions for a week, we parted suddenly for our seperate lives. Me right to work\n(Kris had a bet that I would go home early...she lost!), and Aidan right to...\nwell, whatever kids do in the summer...watch Three&#39;s Company reruns?</p>\n<p>And so ended a great climbing trip. Like all of them it began with high hopes,\nbut plenty of apprehension and uncertainty. It ended feeling like something\npre-ordained - each choice we had made was the Right one. Favorite pitches\ncollected to be savored later. A new private vocabulary that we&#39;d invented,\nunique to the trip and participants.</p>\n<p>Oh, and we saw Lynn Hill at the Toulumne Grill. That was pretty cool.\nNaturally, we were afraid to speak.</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/topodaff.jpg\"><img src=\"images/topodaff.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on DAFF Dome</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/readytofly.jpg\"><img src=\"images/readytofly.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>How many carabiners?</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/callinghome.jpg\"><img src=\"images/callinghome.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The evening phone home</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/michaelincamp.jpg\"><img src=\"images/michaelincamp.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The luxury tent cabin</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/strangecar.jpg\"><img src=\"images/strangecar.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>What a wierd car</i></p>\n"}
