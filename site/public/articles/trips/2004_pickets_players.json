Like Theron, he sees\nthe mountains as populated by magic and demons. If they ever become just\nrocks and snow, he&#39;ll probably stay home and play with his extensive\nStar Wars collection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/playerbeta.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We had a most important &quot;virtual teammate&quot; in the form of guidebooks,\nmaps, emails from friends on \n<a href=\"http://www.cascadeclimbers.com\">CascadeClimbers.com</a>, and inspiring\nphotos that give energy to a great trip like this.
