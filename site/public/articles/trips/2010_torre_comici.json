{"date":"2010-8-5","title":"Torre Comici, Casara Route","blurb":"attempt, with Jesse","description":"<h2 id=\"-casara-route-iv-7-pitches-\">&quot;Casara&quot; Route (IV+, 7 pitches)</h2>\n<p>In the morning it was raining. So much for one of the hard routes. It\nwas also very cold. Finally, around 11 weather lightened up enough to make\nthe hike back over the Col-de-Medo Pass for the Torre Comici. It was an\neasy climb, but at least a chance to get something done with my last day.\nWe endured a long and tiring scree climb to reach the base. Jesse was pretty\ntired, and I definitely understood where he was coming from!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812274333/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4812274333_baa8127ff0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I had the first lead, up a IV+ dihedral and chimney. Near the end of the\npitch, my fingers got really cold. With the wind whistling, me blowing\non my fingers, and trying to negotiate the crux moves, things didn&#39;t look\ngreat for continuing. I reached the belay and Jesse said his motivation\nhad just crumpled away. Realizing that we were looking at some only moderately-enjoyable\nhours of cold and mediocre climbing, I had no problem with leaving. I rapped\nand cleaned the gear, we zoomed down the scree and like that, my trip came\nto a close. Jesse would do some hiking and then continue a grand summer\nof climbing that is still going on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812900976/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4812900976_60ab0bdbca_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Looking down on &quot;Frozen Fingers Chimney&quot;</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812275353/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4812275353_65cdf9d6bd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The way beyond.

(Yes, for the Dolomites, this is &quot;bomber&quot;)</em></p>\n<p>It had been great fun. I was really happy to meet and climb with Jesse.\nWe had many great conversations and saw totally &quot;eye to eye&quot; on the meaning\nof and practice of the climbing game. I&#39;m eager for him to come back. I&#39;m\npositive we&#39;ll bite off some big chunks of our shared bigger goals. Including\nSaturday&#39;s Totenkirchl climb (described in another report), we&#39;d climbed\nmore than 70 pitches in 9 days.</p>\n<p>Berg heil!</p>\n"}
