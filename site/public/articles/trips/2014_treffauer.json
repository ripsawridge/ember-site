Strangely, Georg managed\nto find a weather window: the next day, exactly at the Wilder Kaiser, it\nwouldn&#39;t be raining. So we had to mount back up and drive over there.</p>\n<p>Under blue skies we hiked to the Gruttenhütte. We had two ropes, quickdraws and\nsome cams, nuts and slings. The route itself was <a href=\"http://www.stadler-markus.de/alpinklettern/wilder-kaiser/kletterrouten/treffauer/routeninfos/beschreibung/ostpfeiler-jubilaeumsweg-2000.html\">whimsically set up on\n9/19/1999</a>, \nand is one of the\n<a href=\"http://www.bergsteigen.com/klettern/tirol/kaiser-gebirge/jubilaeumsweg-2000\">longest routes</a> in this area of the Kaiser. The authors, two\nHaselsberger brothers and a friend H. Pirkner are famous for the group of climbs\non the other side of the peak like <a href=\"http://www.mountainwerks.org/cma/2009/viaromantica.html\">&quot;Via\nRomantica&quot;</a> \nand &quot;Blue Moon.&quot; We were\ninterested to see what they did in a &quot;foreign&quot; valley :).</p>\n<p>A cloud engulfed us in the great scree basin below the route and never\nleft. Alas, we wouldn&#39;t see the sun or more than 50 meters in front of us for\nmany hours. This terrible August weather had found us even here. But at least it\nremained dry so we continued doggedly. I got irritated with crossing the scree\nbasin at low height, so I dropped back down to the trail and listened to Georgs\nprogress to determine where to turn back up. I found it so tiring, and was\ndisgusted with the cloud. In truth, the main reason I wanted to climb this\nroute, which I know is not known for it&#39;s incredible climbing, was to experience\nthe big-wall ambience in kind of unknown area. The thick cloud meant that\nwouldn&#39;t be possible and as I took two steps up, one step back in the enormous\nscree field I cursed inwardly. Georg waited patiently above, his traversing plan\nhaving worked much better.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822081409'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5578/14822081409_706019a7af_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael on pitch 10</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14985805596'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5582/14985805596_5545e81fc8_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg finishing pitch 11</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14985808096'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5589/14985808096_d1b5576188_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg on pitch 12</p>\n<p>Finally I arrived and sent Georg off to lead the first pitch. We combined the\nfirst three pitches in a long simul-climb to grade IV. Normally this would have\nfelt easy and routine with bolt protection, but wow...this was an exceptionally\nloose mountain! I think the German word &quot;splittrig&quot; describes this situation\npretty well. On the south side of the Wilder Kaiser, many rocks have cracks\nthroughout, and when you have to treat them as solid blocks a feeling of\ninsecurity results. Multiply this over entire pitches and the route gets an air\nof seriousness...despite the bolts!</p>\n<p>Georg had gone up and right on easier ground. I took the next block, turning\nleft around a corner and straight up again for two grade III pitches to a long\nsection of walking on grassy ledges. We came together for a moment, then I led\ntwo more pitches of III and II to reach a gray wall, impressive after the long\ntrip through scruffy ground to get here. Georg led a very nice grade IV pitch up\nthe wall to a vertical section. I headed up, enjoying the grade V terrain very\nmuch. But at one point I couldn&#39;t see the next bolt and wondered which way to\ngo. Finally I saw it, quite camoflagued! This was an excellent pitch though.\nGeorg took the V+ pitch that went up an overhanging corner. We felt a few\nraindrops and he sped up so as to make it over the crux before solid rain! But\nluckily the precip stopped. As I followed a foothold broke while I cleaned some\ngear. I think I managed to hold on without stressing the belay but maybe\nnot. The crack at the overhang was seeping water. This wasn&#39;t a really easy\npitch!</p>\n<p>I led pitches 13 and 14 as a simul-climb again, confusing Georg by stopping at\nthe belay for pitch 15. In fact I&#39;d had a pretty strange move here, carefully\ncrabbing around a rotten tower that partially collapsed under my\nweight. Ugh. I have to say, I&#39;ve been on plenty of loose terrain, but this upper\nroute really takes the cake. There are so many rocks that crumble or break into\nshards if you use them meaningfully. You have to distribute your weight\ncarefully. With the blowing clouds in our crumbling spires I have to admit the\nclimb had atmosphere though!</p>\n<p>Georg led 15, 16 and 17 as a simul-climb. Though rated II and III, this would be\nmentally taxing to solo not only for the extremely loose rock but also\nroutefinding uncertainty. On the last pitch, a 10 meter section of vertical rock\nstretched the definition of grade III, but at least it was very solid.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822090309'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5566/14822090309_6a8478813d_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg on toothy terrain with the Ostgipfel behind</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822158890'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5574/14822158890_cdd7b5f76e_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael finishes the zwei Zacken</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15008805355'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3892/15008805355_8bca8f66e2_b.jpg'></a>\nYay, made it!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822186198'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3869/14822186198_8c8b584b71_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking down the ridge</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822276557'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3863/14822276557_0865ffbaff_b.jpg'></a>\nMichael circumvents the overhanging tower</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822168060'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3902/14822168060_e69e6d3212_b.jpg'></a>\nDrinking water</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822285007'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3900/14822285007_dca47959e8_b.jpg'></a>\nWe get below the clouds</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822288807'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3908/14822288807_8135db5050_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg&#39;s panorama of Kopfkraxen routes</p>\n<p>Now as far as we knew, we were on the Ostgipfel (East Summit). In the cloud, we\ndidn&#39;t really know what to do, only that abseils along the ridge were in our\nfuture.  We climbed uncertainly down in a diagonal direction to a little abcess\namong rotten teeth. I set off, traversing the teeth and sometimes slinging the\nsharp summits. I reached a tower I did <em>not</em> want to have to\ndownclimb. Occasionally the cloud would lift a bit and we&#39;d see what an airy\nplace we were in. Georg arrived at my summit and noticed the rappel\nanchors. Yay! We were still on route. It was a good thing we had plenty of nuts\nand cams. </p>\n<p>We had a single 50 meter rope (yeah, I know :)), and now had to make two\n25-meter rappels into the gray murk. Gulp. Happily, this worked\nperfectly. Actually we made 3 rappels, and employed some extra caution in face\nof the uncertainty: the first person was lowered and the second rappeled once\nthe way was scouted. This was helpful on the first rappel because I ended up\npassing the station and had to climb back up to it on non-trivial terrain. It\nwas great to have a top rope.</p>\n<p>Now we traversed pretty easily across nonetheless dangerous terrain. Georg led\nthis half-walk half-climb to a belay point at a notch in front of an overhanging\ntower. Then I led 3 grade II and III pitches as a long simul-climb to the\nsummit, first traversing under the overhanging tower, then regaining the ridge\ncrest. Hilariously, I came upon a single bolt here, long after I&#39;d given up\nlooking for such strange things! At that moment the clouds opened up for about\n15 seconds, giving a panoramic view of huge air, towers and Georg 30 meters\nbelow crabbing up to the crest. Before I could get my camera it was gone, and it\nwas just me again in the mist. The sound of breathing, the clicking of gear and\ncareful steps on collapsing ledges. Soon I was at the summit cross, taking a\nhalf turn around it to belay Georg up.</p>\n<p>Well. It was interesting!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14985826866'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3896/14985826866_cb84f5c479_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg is actually jogging here</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14822199908'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5558/14822199908_dec2e22927_b.jpg'></a>\nFrom the parking lot</p>\n<p>As we hiked down, we dropped below the cloud, getting enjoyable views of the\nKopfkraxen and other Western Kaiser stuff. Georg pointed out an easy slab climb\non the lower wall. Then I laughed when he said: &quot;I just saw a goat walk across\nthe crux of this climb.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now we had a long hike around the south side of Tuxeck until we could follow a\nroute down to the car at the Wochenbrunner Alm. And thus ends the story of how\nwe drove for two days looking for something to climb and finally got something\nin our own backyard. :).</p>\n"}
