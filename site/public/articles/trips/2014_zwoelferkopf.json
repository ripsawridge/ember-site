Also, Kris needed the car to take the boys to a summertime\nweightlifting comp. Finally, a late night Friday with a couple of grillfests\nmeant I woke up Saturday morning unprepared to use the beautiful weekend.</p>\n<p>But these problems can be solved! I decided to climb the Blassengrat to the\nJubilaeumsgrat bivouac hut, then continue to the Zugspitze summit the next\nday. I brought a helmet and rock shoes, two days of food, and regular hiking\nequipment. On the train to Garmisch, I realized I should have at least brought\nan ice axe as well, nevermind crampons. Oh well.</p>\n<p>It was already brutally hot as I walked from the train station to\nHammersbach. I&#39;d had some interesting conversations the night before with Janina\nand her roommate, talking about things like the status of women through history,\n&quot;Adam Smithian&quot; economics, how interesting the nuances of just the right words\nare, pre-history. Another of Janinas friends specializes in creating authentic\nclothing and jewelry from early Christian and Pagan times. All really cool\nstuff!</p>\n<p>I walked to the mountains and lost patience with my cleaving to man-made\ninstallations in order to bring my trip across. I was going to pay for a lift to\neliminate much hiking, I was going to seek out a shelter, possibly cramped with\ncoughing, begrudging people? No, I thought!</p>\n<p>On the hot and steaming road, I saw the Zwölferkopf shimmering high above,\ndirectly before me. I had climbed it once before with a friend, Alexander. But\nwe fought with hail and lightning on the summit, and getting down was fraught\nwith danger on the wet rocks and slick grassy slopes.</p>\n<p>Now I had a chance to climb it again and get a proper view. Where would I sleep?\nWhat do I care! Perhaps I&#39;ll follow the ridge all the way to the\nRiffelscharte. I remembered Georgs description of that trip, he seemed to\nshudder as he described the stressful and endless towers of loose rock. Or maybe\nnot. It would be many hours before I&#39;d have to decide that.</p>\n<p>But the point is that the decision to &quot;not care&quot; about sleeping was very\nliberating. I had enough food, I only had to take every chance I could find to\ndrink as much water as possible, because there would be none above the last\ntrees. I refilled my water from the river at Hammersbach, among the milling\ntourists. I hiked up \nlistening to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfAuX5kJOl8\">Loreena McKennitt</a> \nsong about a highwayman,\nagain a reminder of conversations yesterday (&quot;<em>what is the term for a robber on\nthe road?</em>&quot;). Weirdly, at this moment a black snake slithered across the path\nright in front of me.</p>\n<p>There should be a name for the state of mind when concurrences and coincidences\npile up rather pleasingly in the mind. And all this combined with an adventurous\nundertaking that quickens the blood at the same time. I was in a liminal state,\nhalfway between worlds. So for example, I decided that the black snake was\nsignificant, but felt free at the same time to interpret the meaning\ncreatively. To me, it meant I was crossing a boundary, and the occasion was\nominous only in the sense that all border crossings contain seeds of danger. But\nI was going to cross, and I thanked the snake for reminding me to be cautious.</p>\n<p>So in this free-wheeling state, I made my way up trails and roads to the hidden\n<em>Selbstversorghütte</em> (self-service cabin) in the woods below the\nZwölferkopf. There are no signs, perhaps because people would show up and\nquerulously ask for beer. Eventually I managed to get there.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Ist jemand zu Hause?&quot;</em> I called out. It&#39;s polite not to approach a hut too directly. A man\nappeared between hanging clothes. </p>\n<p><em>&quot;Gibt es noch Wasser im Quelle?&quot;</em></p>\n<p>He explained that yes, there was water and it was only a couple of minutes down\nthe hill.</p>\n<p>Yes! Had the spring been dry, my plan would be in serious trouble. I needed a\nLOT of water on what felt like the hottest day of the year. I drank a couple of\nliters, and headed out again, waterlogged. Before long I was scratching up\ndesert-like scree slopes finding the best purchase in places with a faint\nfootstep. Strange rotten bags of dirt dotted the slope, each spilled open and\nblackened. Finally I realized they must have been part of a nighttime exhibit in\nwhich the slope was lit up was fire. They were meant to light and burn\nharmlessly in place. How many years ago had that been?</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14722119403'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2935/14722119403_50df330234_b.jpg'></a>\nA couple guys coming up</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515803247'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5594/14515803247_16fb1d1fb8_b.jpg'></a>\nNearly a wrong turn</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699072791'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3843/14699072791_1c8f0eb74d_b.jpg'></a>\nClean cracks</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515813787'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3904/14515813787_cbdef6230d_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the Zwölferkopf</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14702264345'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3911/14702264345_23d22b9cd4_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the crazy-exposed trail</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515581880'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5583/14515581880_f2c7e3e21b_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking back</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515607678'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5579/14515607678_2322530eaa_b.jpg'></a>\nNot a bad view</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515588790'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3914/14515588790_b339172d74_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Eibsee</p>\n<p>I entered the stony cirque between the Manndl and the Zwölferkopf, kicking\nsteps up a snowfield to change into rock shoes at the Gedankentafel marking a\nlong-ago death. I carefully climbed the rotten rock...no mistakes allowed!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A brief comment about soloing in alpine terrain.</p>\n<p>Soloing terrain like this might seem crazy, but as the veteran of hundreds of\nclimbs with partners and alone, it&#39;s clear that in the loose and protectionless\nterrain before or after the &quot;meat&quot; of a rock climb, there is not much a rope can\ndo. In these situations usually it just slows the party down and worse, knocks\nrocks off onto the second climber. In the case of a fall, it&#39;s likely that the\nleader has no protection in place, or protection that would likely fail. In the\nabsolute best case, the rope can mean the difference between the hospital and\nthe grave. But in the average case in this terrain, there is no difference.</p>\n<p>The rope rises in value in proportion to the protectability of the\nterrain. Therefore, whether you are alone or with a partner on such\nterrain...you are alone, and you may as well realize it early.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14679260016'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5553/14679260016_4de4f300e8_b.jpg'></a>\nWild animals</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14701984162'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3920/14701984162_3def0b4ceb_b.jpg'></a>\nA place for the night</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699100121'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5592/14699100121_cddc39624b_b.jpg'></a>\nMore dawn</p>\n<p>It took some time to find the start of the route, even though I&#39;d been here in 2010. I \nclimbed the first pitch slowly, mindful of the danger of a wrong\nturn. Pitch two had a couple harder moves (IV), but they were joyful to climb\nbecause the rock turned strong and clean. In fact I got into trouble here\nbecause the climbing was so nice. I sped past the third belay, and ended up\nconfused at the fourth belay station, wondering if I should go left to the ridge\ncrest or continue for another 50 meters on a great tilted face. Both looked\nreasonable, which is kind of a problem! I cursed that I didn&#39;t remember this\nspot from 4 years ago. My own rule in soloing is that you can&#39;t venture more\nthan 10 or 15 meters from a known point into unknown terrain, and that you have\nto absolutely be able to downclimb everything in that state. I had to check out\nthe right option carefully now, so I ventured over and tried three chimneys in\nturn. Each proved to be harder than the grade III climbing I expected, and there\nwas an &quot;unclimbed&quot; quality to the rock. Usually, there are subtle signs that\npeople have been by. A slight wear on important holds, a reduction in loose\nrock, a lack of black lichen on the rock, a lack of wet, muddy vegetation\npeeking out from cracks.</p>\n<p>After 20 minutes or so, I was sure: this was not the way.</p>\n<p>Later, following the ramp left to the ridge crest I was very happy in my\nchoice. Had I climbed up one of those chimneys I would have ended up below\nvertical faces that remained loose and scruffy. Whew!</p>\n<p>Now on the crest, everything looked better. 3 easy pitches followed on solid\nrock with tufts of grass. I had heard voices before, and I saw their\nowners...two guys dealing with the grade IV cracks on the crest. I climbed up,\nmet them for a friendly exchange of banter, and climbed through for some\nexcellent crack climbing with good hand jams.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515606560'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3923/14515606560_e2e8acd7ea_b.jpg'></a>\nNice trail</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699111461'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3897/14699111461_416f863a44_b.jpg'></a>\nAmazing sky</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699113451'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3848/14699113451_16ff9d4139_b.jpg'></a>\nThe glacier and summit beyond.</p>\n<p>I thought the crux of the route was the small overhang that began the\n&quot;Badplatten.&quot; A couple of poor footholds, and some ungainly heaving got me onto\nthe slab, where I rested a few minutes. One of the guys below came up and\nremarked that he thought that move was grade V- or so! More clean climbing got\nme into the great gully that marks the last easy pitches. Starting to feel\ntired, I reached the summit under a broiling sun. The feeling of pleasant\nintersection with subjective interpretation of reality had been burned away by\nthe demands of constant focus on what was in front of me. It wouldn&#39;t be until\nnight that I regained that feeling, but even then only to a degree.</p>\n<p>But that&#39;s okay. Intense concentration is it&#39;s own reward.</p>\n<p>Now I looked across to the Grosser Waxensteinturm. Could I traverse the ridge\nover there? It looked like there would be climbing moves. I wished for the\nguidebook with a description. I decided it would be a bit foolhardy to just try\nand get over there without knowing at least something. Oh well, so much for\n&quot;perfect freedom!&quot; So I hiked down the rather unnerving trail to the\nMittagsscharte. I followed the tedious ups and downs of the Schafsteig to the\njunction with the route down to the valley, then continued on to the route back\nup to the Grosser Waxensteinturm. I left my pack here and climbed the\nentertaining route to the summit. It goes right up a polished stone watercourse,\nsometimes with some real climbing moves. Some pitons and bolts were present at\nharder spots.</p>\n<p>A nice view from the summit, but also the realization that I was pretty\ntired. The heat of the day had an exhausting effect. I climbed down, got my pack\nand continued the long journey on the Schafsteig. Now I met many <em>Gämse</em>\n(mountain deer), who kind of wheezed at me as I went by. The sun gradually\ndropped behind the mountain walls, and I dropped into the valley. Far below I\nsaw a grassy slope with sheep and a waterfall. I was incredibly thirsty, having\nfinished my last water an hour before. I&#39;d need to go as far down into the\nvalley as necessary to get water.</p>\n<p>One interesting difference between a granitic mountain range and a limestone\nrange seems to be that water sources in the latter disappear more quickly in\nsummer. My thought is that the rock is porous, and water sources have more\nopportunities to disappear from sight much sooner.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515630109'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2903/14515630109_b3af397c5d_b.jpg'></a>\nClimbers on the glacier</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14679282646'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3875/14679282646_0465b035ab_b.jpg'></a>\nEberhardt and his sons</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699901074'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3854/14699901074_467f21e355_b.jpg'></a>\nA gaggle of climbers</p>\n<p>Finally I reached the sheep and a fairly protected water source. I drank two\nliters greedily, then took another liter down the valley to the first flat\ngrassy spot with a little bit of wind protection. Now it was almost fully\ndark. I settled down on my pack, arranged it&#39;s contents around me as wind\nprotection. I had my rock shoes for a pillow, a light down jacket as a &quot;sleeping\nbag&quot; and a windproof jacket as a &quot;blanket.&quot; I ate two peanut butter sandwiches\nand put some Landjaeger sausage in my jacket to warm up for later. Around\nmidnight that sausage was delicious!</p>\n<p>Sausage, like cheese and chocolate, can&#39;t be eaten cold.</p>\n<p>I slept now and then, woke up shivering, thought about life, looked at the\nstars, then slept a little more. I enjoyed myself a lot. Some famous mountaineer\nsaid that a night out was psychologically an important part of adventure, and\nmuch as I usually try to avoid it, I have to agree. I played the thousands of\nfeet and hundreds of holds and positions over in my head. I imagined taking\ndifferent paths. I stretched all the sore muscles, which felt good. I shivered\nsome more, and watched the moon across my arc of sky.</p>\n<p>I woke up at around 4 am as a light swept across me. Crunching footsteps, and a\nman stood before me. &quot;Is this the trail?&quot; he said in English. </p>\n<p>&quot;No, you just stepped off it, back to the right!&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Thanks!&quot; he said, and crunched away. Who was he? Where was he going at this\nstrange hour? It was especially odd that he was traveling down valley and not\nup. I sat up and watched the dawn.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14515862907'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5584/14515862907_c5504079bc_b.jpg'></a>\nThe fun-plex</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14702016272'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3862/14702016272_b93f814875_b.jpg'></a>\nCheck out the people on the glacier</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14699909224'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5594/14699909224_de7dc414b9_b.jpg'></a>\nNear the summit</p>\n<p>At 5 am I started to walk, stiffly. Three men appeared, and I sent them ahead\nbecause I planned to move slowly. The pilgrimage to the Zugspitze summit had\nbegun, now in deep pink and orange light from the rising sun. I hiked up the\ntrail and cables uneventfully, mind rather cotton-encased. I passed the men, a\nfather and two sons when they stopped to eat second breakfast. Later, on the\nglacier I ran into trouble. I had to cross rock-hard smooth water ice to get to\nsome steps melted and bashed into the slope from previous parties. I tried all\naround the area, using rocks and my ski poles to make a step. But it was too\nhard.</p>\n<p>The three men came up and I asked if they had anything to help, maybe an ice\naxe. Or worst case, I thought that if one of them stood in the bottom bashed\nstep, I could grab their ankles and do a funny kind of lying down pull-up to\nreach that step!</p>\n<p>But instead they decided one of them would take off his in-step crampons above\nthe difficulty and toss them down for me to wear. That was really nice! And it\nworked perfectly! I was happy for several reasons, including general\n&quot;comradeship in the mountains.&quot; They could have easily told me how irresponsible\nI was to be there and what happens if, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>Together we crossed the glacier and found the entrance, using the higher one\nbecause the lower entrance had an impossible moat to cross. I returned the\ncrampons and headed off, getting some nice pictures of them later.</p>\n<p>The nice climbing in the sun here was fantastic. But by the time I reached the\nfinal slope, I was dead tired. I mentally abandoned the plan to hike down the\nStopselsteig, and go ahead and give in to the mechanical world. On top I chatted\nwith a family from Seattle, then shared a beer and breakfast with Eberhardt and\nhis sons. One of them knew Stuart Hardy, who I only know by reputation, having\nclimbed many of the routes he set in the Thalkirchen climbing gym.</p>\n<p>The adventure ends here, the rest is a weary procession of lifts and trains to\nget home. It was a 25 hour adventure, with 3500 meters of elevation gain and 12\npitches of technical climbing. What fun! I came home, intending to play with the\nkids and just crashed after a shower!</p>\n"}
