{"date":"2008-9-19","title":"Mom and I visit the Dolomites (briefly!)","description":"<p>On the way home from Florence, the weather was too good to miss a driving\ntrip to the Dolomites. Just north of Bolzano we turned east and rapidly\nclimbed up into the mountains. We were hungry for quite a while, but also\nin a hurry to make it to the Pordoi Pass in order to take a lift up to\nthe Pordoi Spitze. This peak has an amazing 360 degree view of surrounding\nmountains. Finally we found a little fast food stand (there are surprisingly\nfew of these, in fact the area seemed kind of deserted), and got a hamburger\nand a Panini sandwich.</p>\n<p>After a drive through a pretty valley we started the first of 35 180 degree\nswitchbacks that would get us up to the pass. Mom did really well...I&#39;ve\nmade people sick with my driving on these things! But I&#39;m a very mild driver\ncompared to the Italians, and especially to the motorcycles, trust me!</p>\n<p>We got to the pass and it was freezing cold. We grabbed what jackets we\ncould find and bought our tickets. The lift took us up several thousand\nfeet in just 5 minutes. I was really happy to be able to show Mom the area.\nThe Dolomites are really my favorite place in the Alps. The relief between\nsummit and valley is very great, and very steep too. There is only one\nglacier in the whole range, but the many sheer cliffs make up for that.\nAnd the meadows are so peaceful and friendly, making a great contrast with\nthe spiky peaks.</p>\n<p>Later we sat in a meadow below the Sella Pass. We had the massive Langkofel\npeaks on our left, and Piz Boe with it&#39;s dozen or so subsidiary peaks on\nthe right.
