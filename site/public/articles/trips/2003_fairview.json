{"date":"2003-6-18","title":"Fairview Dome","description":"<p><h2>North Face (Regular Route) (5.9, IV)</h2></p>\n<h3>June 18, 2003</h3>\n\n<p><em>back to <a href=\"cali.html\">Sierras</a>...</em></p>\n<p><i>Text by Aidan Haley</i></p>\n<p>Still off the natural high from the Matthes Crest...(see the day before)...\nMichael and I set off to climb another of the areas most famous features. \nThe Fairview Dome is the largest wall in Toulumne Meadows rising nearly \n1000ft. from base to summit. The rock is of course stellar, and although \npolished on the first pitch, the route delivers pitch after pitch of \nunforgettable crack climbing. </p>\n<p>Our strategy for the route was to wake up late and hopefully the &quot;crowds&quot; \nwould be far enough in front of us that they would pose little problem \nin our attempts of finishing the route. So we had a leisurely morning \nwaking up around 9 to the lovely California sun drenching or sleeping \nbags. We read and talked to two nice guys who had climbed the route \nthe day before and had been troubled by the &quot;hordes.&quot; They thought \nour approach was a good one to wait out the morning in hopes our speed \nwould see us off the wall before the afternoon thunderclouds rolled. So \naround 10 we drove into the park and stopped at the Toulumne grill for \nbreakfast/lunch and to buy some snacks for the climb. They sure do cook \nup a mean chicken sandwich! We got to the parking lot around 10:30 and \nstarted hiking to the base eager to get a look at the route to see about \nthe crowds (you can&#39;t get the best view from the road...the trees block most \nof the route from view. To get the best view of the face, hike up the \nopposite side of the road a ways and you will be rewarded with awesome \nviews). </p>\n<p>To our pleasant surprise as we reached the edge of \nthe forest we saw one party three pitches up and thats it! &quot;Wow we really \nlucked out!&quot; So we hurried to the moat to secure our spot. The moat was \na grungy, uncomfortable spot. We ended up placing two nuts to hang on in \nour harnesses while we switched shoes and geared up for the first pitch. \nThe first pitch had been on both our minds for some time \nnow. I had told Michael earlier in the day he should take it. I thought it \nwas a generous thing to do and I was...well...kind of intimidated by the \nsustained 200 ft. of 5.9 climbing. As it turned out I wasn&#39;t alone on this \none. Michael started up the pitch and two moves up he put in a piece and \nhung. &quot;Man this is hard Aidan!&quot; He didn&#39;t want to give up so he gave it \nanother gallant effort but alas nerves got the best of him. He climbed \ndown to our little stance frustrated at himself. &quot;I am sorry \nAidan I just feel really uncomfortable up there.&quot;\nI totally understood and told him not to worry about it. So it was up to \nme if we wanted to continue or find something else to climb that day. I \nwanted Fairview. So, I took the rack and started up the pitch, a little \nbit nervous and scared but excited all the same. Finger lock after finger \nlock I became more and more comfortable and after a couple meters I was \nloving every minute of it. The finger locks were all there and although \nis was polished it made the climbing that much more exciting. After awhile I \ncame to the crux section where the crack thins and the feet disappear and \non top of that 10-foot section of crack was wet. I plunged in a blue \nMetolious cam and finger locked my way up. Having a long reach is \nbeneficial because you can get above the crux in fewer moves. </p>\n<p>My \nfirst effort was thwarted by the slimey crack but I sneaked by it \non my second try but almost slipped out of the crack at one point. \nAfter that, 5.8 crack climbing brought me to a nice ledge with a tree. \nOur 60m rope just barely made it to the ledge, I think I had about 3 or \n4 feet left. I put Michael on belay and brought him up. He struggled on \nthis pitch and just wasn&#39;t feeling himself. \nHe told me he couldn&#39;t lead the next pitch and that I would have to do it. \nI was more than happy to take the lead. I thought that if we got past this \nnext pitch Michael would begin to feel better having the difficulties behind \nus. The cool thing about this route is that the first two pitches are the \nhardest and they get progressively easier the higher you get. So I was \nfeeling optimistic. I took off past the 5.9 bulge and into the sustained \n5.8 corner that led me past a small roof to a really cool hanging belay. \nI brought Michael up and saw the smile on his face as he climbed past the \nroof. He was loving it. He regained his confidence and after some water \nheaded off to tackle the 5.8 block pitch that led us up to Cresent Ledge. \nFrom there we relaxed a bit and ate some food. </p>\n<p>Since Michael had his \nconfidence back and was feeling great I told him he could lead the \nnext couple of pitches since I was pretty satisfied with the first two. \nSo off he went up this beautiful 5.6 corner to another great ledge \nbelay. He brought me up and instantly took off on the next pitch \nwhich consisted of a cool corner ramp that led to an easy but \nintimidating roof (5.7). Michael, as he always does, styled up the pitch. \nI was greeted by a man from Portland, OR at my ledge while I was \nbelaying Michael and we commented on the lack of people on the wall. \nThe next pitch was a long 4th class/5th class rightward traverse to \ngain a 4th class gully. Michael brought me up to the belay and I headed \noff on the upper 4th class section of the wall. Every so often we \nencountered a low 5th class step but for the most part it was easy \ngoing. I popped over the edge and took up the rope as Michael made \nthe same moves to the top. We shook hands and we were on top. It was \n3:30, only 4 and a half-hours after we left the base. We were stoked at \nwhat great speed we made and that we only encountered one other party \non the wall! Man we lucked out. The party from Portland took our picture \nand we took theirs and off we went done the back slabs of the dome toward \nthe forest. The climbers&#39; trail done to the car was beautiful and we looked \nup at climbers on a different route. We reached the car thoroughly \nsatisfied with our accomplishment.</p>\n<p>What made this climb even more memorable was the real sense of camaraderie \nI felt with Michael. Early in the trip he had helped me get through a \ntough time and I was really glad to return the favor. When he was \nreally hating it on the wall and not having fun I took the leads and \ngot him through the low he was feeling. It was great to see and \nexperience the mental battles we fight with the sport we love. \nThanks Michael for a great day in the hills...your friendship is priceless.</p>\n<p><i>\n(Michael) This day started very difficult for me. On the first pitch I was very\nconcious of a long fall I&#39;d taken a few weeks before on a similar pitch in Leavenworth.\nEverything was so polished, and I wanted to sew the pitch up through those\nsections. But our rack was really a &quot;5.6 mountain rack&quot; - I&#39;d have to run\nit out a lot. In that strange mental calculus, I added that fact to my gut\nfeeling that I&#39;d fall, and had to abandon the lead. Then when I followed\nAidan&#39;s remarkable lead of the pitch, I was astonished to realize it was even harder than\nI&#39;d expected! Somehow, this whole thing made me angry with myself, and I\narrived at the belay frazzled, ready to quit climbing for the day.\nIt&#39;s kind of like playing something on the guitar just great, then a few days\nlater you can&#39;t do it? That used to really chap my hide. But as Aidan related,\nfollowing another more moderate pitch restored my equilibrium. There is nothing\nlike a great climbing partner and friend to get you back on track, and realize\nthere is nothing else you&#39;d rather be doing. \n</i> </p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairview2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairview2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Fairview Dome, all bow before her!</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/michaelfairp1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/michaelfairp1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael on the first pitch</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairp1tired.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairp1tired.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael didn&#39;t like the first pitch much :-(</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairp2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairp2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan starting the second pitch</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairp4.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairp4.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Looking down on pitch 4</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/michaelfairp4.jpg\"><img src=\"images/michaelfairp4.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Climbing on the fourth pitch</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairp5.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairp5.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on pitch five</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairexit.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairexit.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The final pitches</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairtop.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairtop.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>On the summit</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/worldodomes.jpg\"><img src=\"images/worldodomes.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Fairview Dome is on the lower right</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/fairdetail.jpg\"><img src=\"images/fairdetail.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The route drawn in red</i></p>\n"}
