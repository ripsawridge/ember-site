I wanted to hike above the Achensee,\nbut when I saw the sun hitting the Montscheinspitze behind the Seebergspitze\nI decided I had to go there. Parking at the Gernalm I started up. The first\n500 meters were on a road, but it was quite steep and efficient. At the\npass I headed up to the Plumsjoch and admired the views.</p>\n<p>The weather was very good locally, it was very obvious that my local area\nwas protected by the &quot;foehn,&quot; a band of high pressure that sometimes develops\nover the Northern Alps. It also brings a warm wind, which can melt snow\nrapidly. Clearly, a good bit of snow had melted since the weekend before.</p>\n<p>From Plumsjoch, I descended and reclimbed to the Montscheinspitze.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5132568050/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1384/5132568050_df0bb8f193.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Now I was also getting a view of the Achensee and the Rofan Mountains\non the eastern bank.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5132568842/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1353/5132568842_4d48c7de66.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The trail on the Montscheinspitze sometimes required me to use my hands\nand be very careful on slippery snow. It&#39;s telling that it took me 2 hours\nto the summit where signs advertised 1.5 hours! But having only been out\nthree hours so far, from the summit I wondered what to to next. Ah, that\nwill do! The picture below shows the Satteljoch and the Kompat from the\nsummit. I&#39;ll wander over there and bag those summits:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5131968293/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5131968293_baf0a2ff08.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>This turned out to be a great idea because views of the Engtal (&quot;narrow\nvalley&quot;) became fantastic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5132573146/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1256/5132573146_cc1f2eefcd.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5131972207/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1102/5131972207_596e83d1ae.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>By the time I got to the top of Kompat I was pretty tired. At one point\non the ridge near the Satteljoch the wind became incredibly strong. I had\nto walk leaning radically to the side in order to stay up. Tough Latschen\nbushes were being shaken like grass. But the wind wasn&#39;t very cold, thank\ngoodness, and I was glad the ridge wasn&#39;t especially narrow! Some more\nfolks from Munich were on top and we chatted. I got a good view of the\nLaliderer Walls, including the Herzogkante. The Steinfalk and associated\npeaks looks very adventurous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5131974841/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/5131974841_e6fa7563ed.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>And I got to see back to the Montscheinspitze from earlier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5131975767/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1372/5131975767_f793f0dd6a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>And Josef and I hiked a week before on the right side of this picture:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5132575358/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1264/5132575358_a3e8477326.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Winter has arrived in the mountains!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5131976421/\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1440/5131976421_8704b92a62.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Elevation gain:</p>\n<p>1921 - 1170 = 751 from gernalm to plumsjoch</p>\n<p>2106 - 1794 = 312 from the sattle to Montscheinspitze</p>\n<p>1921 - 1794 = 127 from the sattle back up to Plumsjoch</p>\n<p>1935 - 1840 = 95 from the pass up to Satteljoch</p>\n<p>2011 - 1805 = 206 for the Kompat climb</p>\n<p>1935 - 1805 = 130 for the climb back up to Satteljoch</p>\n<p>=1585 m</p>\n"}
