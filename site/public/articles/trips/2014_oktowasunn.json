We\ndecided to climb Octowasunn (7-) on the Vorderer Karlsspize. The grade seemed a\nbit burly, but we had our secret weapon, Georg :).</p>\n<p>After some initial scrambling, we climbed pitch one, 6+, and rather\nexciting. There were some dicey moves in the middle, and a long stretch without\ngear. Georg and Julia headed off first, and I followed with Thomas. Happily, I\nhad a few cams, and used the both in a crack below the anchor. You should\ndefinitely bring some extra gear for this climb, it&#39;s not pure bolted sport!</p>\n<p>The next pitch at 6 or 6- was just plain fun. Then the crux slab (7-)\nfollowed. I got scared and asked Georg and Julia to drop a rope! So much for my\nrock climbing hero badge, LOL. Feeling a bit safer, I enjoyed the pitch a\nlot. Really interesting and powerful moves.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15129439544'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7482/15129439544_d1b76d4f5b_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg on the crux pitch</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15750932502'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5603/15750932502_db4ea50338_b.jpg'></a>\nJulia at a belay</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15725688636'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7562/15725688636_c41b8ef65e_b.jpg'></a>\nP3 begins with a short traverse</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15563963078'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7511/15563963078_64519f3d01_b.jpg'></a>\nThomas coming up</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15563516309'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3954/15563516309_be9f328b10_b.jpg'></a>\nThomas arrives at the belay</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15747504541'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7520/15747504541_2e0c47bc32_b.jpg'></a>\nDifficult routefinding</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15564585600'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7570/15564585600_334a28e043_b.jpg'></a>\nJulia on P5 (IV+)</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15130004473'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7492/15130004473_9296aec3aa_b.jpg'></a>\nThomas on P4 (IV+)</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15129457334'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7485/15129457334_bd6aab109d_b.jpg'></a>\nGeorg rappels from P6.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15130009913'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3942/15130009913_7fa288c9ee_b.jpg'></a>\nIt was quite cold!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15563978868'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7502/15563978868_5368669721_b.jpg'></a>\nJulia, undeterred.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15130016483'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3944/15130016483_68ddd3838c_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Vorderer Karlsspitze</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15563545799'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5614/15563545799_361c25b9c8_b.jpg'></a>\nIMG_3721.jpg</p>\n<p>Pitch four was 50 meters long, at grade IV+, and felt rather insecure. Georg had to climb down a significant amount on the route-finding adventure. There was only a single bolt and I used all of my little store of gear. Pitch 5 was very nice (I forgot the grade, maybe 5?). We were getting really cold. Georg and I climbed one more pitch, a pretty burly grade 6. Then we all rappelled together. I think three rappels were enough due to the traversing nature of the route.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15751146052'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5610/15751146052_53653a543d_b.jpg'></a>\nP1040448.jpg</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15129659524'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3953/15129659524_d6d65622cc_b.jpg'></a>\nP1040459.jpg</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15564469537'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7488/15564469537_48a6cd3bfd_b.jpg'></a>\nMountain fashion</p>\n<p>Thanks to Julia, Thomas and Georg for a great day!</p>\n"}
