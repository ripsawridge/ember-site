We rented a cabin and were\njoined by Bob, Mardi, Theron, Peter and Kim for a really fun weekend.\nIt was Kris&#39;s birthday party, and a great climbing fest too. </p>\n<p><b>Also see these fine websites for other versions of the story:</b><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.alpenthyme.org/alp/leavenworth0403/leavenworth0403.htm\">AlpenThyme</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.theronwelch.com/mountains/pnw/2003/index.htm\">TheronWelch</a><br></p>\n<p>Kris and I drove over Friday late afternoon and checked out the awesome\ncabin. Bob and Mardi were already there. While they went to get dinner, we went\nto climb Mountaineer&#39;s Buttress, a real favorite for Kris. We had a good time as\nusual, and she led a short pitch at the end. We came back, ordered some pizza\nand set to enjoying our cabin. Great conversation with Bob, Mardi, Peter and\nKim. The hot tub was awesome!</p>\n<p>The next morning, Peter and I got up early to go climb something. Peter\nmentioned Canary in an offhand way, but was kind of shocked when I began\nspeeding towards Castle Rock instead of Icicle Canyon! Little did he know that I\nalso really wanted to climb Canary. we gathered his rack and my rope, and soon I\nwas leading the first pitch. It started in a corner, with some decent gear\nplacements under the lip of an overhang. I traversed out to the right on\nexciting moves, then continued on an easy face to a long steep corner. Here, the\nclimbing got gradually harder as I kept going, passing a few pitons, using\nfinger and hand jams. More jamming led to fixed slings below a large roof. I had\nto escape through a slot on the right. This was kind of awkward. I ended up\nhanging from the fixed slings for a minute to think about it. Finally I made the\nmoves and was happy to be on the broad Saber Ledge.</p>\n<p>Peter came up, I could hear him say &quot;Wow&quot; and stuff like that now and then. We\nboth had pretty cold fingers and that made it a little harder. His face appeared\nat the slot, and suddenly he was gone! He had fallen, and was now hanging on the\nrope a few feet below the slot. It was a scary place to fall! &quot;I think I&#39;m going\nto throw up,&quot; he said as he made the correct moves and clambered onto the ledge.</p>\n<p>Peter cheered up when I volunteered for the next lead (hee hee!), and soon we\nwere having fun again. After the exciting traverse onto an overhanging block I\nposed in various postures for Peter&#39;s camera because there was an amazing\nhandhold. Tee hee!</p>\n<p>This pitch was also really great. I passed a bolt or two, and continued up a\nsteep face with steller exposure. Stepping this way and that, I placed a cam in\na horizontal crack now and then. Eventually I came to a ledge where I\nestablished a belay. Peter enjoyed the step-across and the rest of the pitch. He\ntook off for the final lead to the top. As I cleaned gear, I thought about what\na great climb Canary is!</p>\n<p>Tee hee! Okay I&#39;ll stop.</p>\n<p>Back at the cabin, we regrouped for a 5 person climb of the R&amp;D Route. Kris,\nTheron and I climbed it via Cocaine Connection, a fun 5.7 slab climb two pitches\nin length. We brought the video camera and filmed Peter and Kim on the normal\nroute off to the left. I had to skip a bolt on the first pitch due to a large\nrunning water streak. Kris hesitated on a steep section with no handholds, then\nsuddenly trusted her feet to get her over. She especially liked the second\npitch. It was easier, and soon we were sitting on a ledge next to Peter and Kim.</p>\n<p>&quot;Wha&#39; happenh?&quot; said Peter, quoting a hilarious line from the new film &quot;A Mighty Wind.&quot; He also said &quot;Wheas my wagon?&quot; to hilarious effect. Soon we were all saying it. </p>\n<p>Theron took off to lead the neat chimney pitch, with Kris and Kim following\nhim. Peter and I went for Cocaine Crack. I led up to the crack, climbed about\nhalfway up, and discovered enough water trickling out that I decided not to\nclimb it any further. It was green and slimy inside! &quot;Wha&#39; happenh?&quot; Peter\nexclaimed.  I lowered off, and we filmed Kris and Kim climbing for a while. Then\nwe climbed the chimney and interupted their girl talk on a ledge. We admired the\nview for a while, then Peter led the final pitch which is always fun.</p>\n<p>We took a wrong turn on the descent, encountering tedious loose ledges and blocks. Soon we were down though.</p>\n<p>Theron, Kris and I went to climb Classic Crack a little ways away while Peter\nand Kim went to the cabin. There was a crowd of people on the route. I\nestablished my position in line. Everybody was much cooler than us, and not\ninclined to shoot the breeze. They had a difficult time, not making it past the\nlower 15 feet of the climb. A female member of the group ended up with serious\ncuts on her hands, dripping blood.</p>\n<p>&quot;OUCH, that&#39;s GOTTA hurt!!&quot; I said. No I didn&#39;t.</p>\n<p>I had never led this climb, only followed it once before with Dan Smith. And I\nwas wearing (you guessed it) &quot;hand jammies.&quot; They really helped me then. Now I\nsettled for tape. It is a really fun climb, with decent rests to place gear\nfrom. The hand jams are perfect. I was really happy to arrive at the top and\nrealize how much easier the climb was for me than before.</p>\n<p>Kris got on a top-rope and worked hard to climb it. She was stopped by a wide\nsection about 15 feet up. Theron was next, and after several tries, made it past\nthe wide section and finished the climb! He did try laybacking part of it, and\nsoon realized that it is an inferior technique for this kind of crack. Theron\nbelayed me up from the top. I had traded shoes with him, and I found his 5.10\nSpires to be rather painful, as they aren&#39;t stiff enough for comfortable foot\njamming.</p>\n<p>Kris picked us up from the top, and we went to the cabin and began our party. We\nhad all kinds of drinks: wine, cocktails, pina coladas, beer, spetzi. We had\nKalbi beef imported from Hawaii, man that was good. Theron made olive-oil\nbiscuits. There was an awesome salad and potatoes. I&#39;m probably forgetting stuff\ntoo! We played Metallica&#39;s Orion on 3 acoustic guitars. We had worked hard on\nthat over the last month (Theron, Kris and myself). Sadly, our drunkeness ruined\nabout 1/4 of the song!</p>\n<p>Things got kind of hazy, but I remember there was a pinada in the shape of a frog, which was\nbeat mercilessly. &quot;<i>OOOhh, right in the <b>FACE!</b></i>&quot; said Theron.</p>\n<p>We played Halo on the X-box, which absolutely riveted Kris, Peter, Bob and\nTheron to the screen. Kim and I fell asleep amid the din of shouting! I stumbled\noff to bed, but surprised an impromptu hot-tub party on my way. Good times!</p>\n<p>The next morning, we got up kind of late even though I&#39;d been promising to go for a morning climb. Theron had never climbed Midway, but really wanted to, so after talking about it briefly we decided to race out there and back.</p>\n<p>Theron led the first pitch when I didn&#39;t trust my shoes for friction at the\nstart. (Probably seeing him thrutch around in them to attempt a layback the day\nbefore had eroded my confidence!) He did really well. I set off for the next\none, taking the &quot;Midway Direct&quot; route, which goes straight up from the belay\nrather than into a fissure on the right. This was really fun! I passed several\nancient pitons, finding the protection good and the climbing enjoyable. I\nbelayed Theron up from the summit. He whooped at key points, such as some fun\nrightward traverses.</p>\n<p>We hurried down, closed up the cabin (sniff), and all went to Peshastin. Bob and\nMardi were already there hiking around. I tried to climb the Tunnel Route on\nOrchard Rock, but was stymied by a hard move from a ledge after the tunnel. I\nbelayed Kim up to my gear belay, then lowered her off another way. She didn&#39;t\nlike the route very much. Nobody else wanted to climb it, so I gathered my gear\nand downclimbed.</p>\n<p>Next, Kris and Theron climbed Martian Diagonal, with Kim and I on their\nheels. Peter filmed the whole thing from various points on the trail to the\nside. We climbed it in three fun pitches, having a grand old time!</p>\n<p>Then we went to Heidelburger&#39;s in honor of Aidan (it&#39;s his favorite place to\neat) and ate some good food. Peter and Kim decided to head home. Theron, Kris\nand I went to climb Gibson&#39;s Crack (5.5) in Icicle Canyon. This is a pretty neat\nclimb. Kris didn&#39;t like it that much though, but she climbed it anyway!</p>\n<p>We walked over to Mountaineer&#39;s Buttress to end our trip. Kris led the first\npitch this time, she did it really well! Her cam placements were\nexcellent. Theron led the second pitch and I got some pictures. I led the final\neasy scramble. We climbed on one 60 meter rope, and I wore tennis shoes for the\nclimb. We hiked down as the sun began to set.</p>\n<p>Kris said it was her favorite birthday ever. Thanks to Theron, Kim, Peter, Mardi\nand Bob for making it so great!!</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/krismountie.jpg\"><img src=\"images/krismountie.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Kris tops out on Mountaineer&#39;s Buttress.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/canaryhole.jpg\"><img src=\"images/canaryhole.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Peter thinking about life as a Canary.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/hangingout.jpg\"><img src=\"images/hangingout.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael preening on Canary.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/cocainec.jpg\"><img src=\"images/cocainec.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael attempting to climb Cocaine Crack.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/midwaydirect.jpg\"><img src=\"images/midwaydirect.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron belays on Midway Direct.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/midwayd2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/midwayd2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron tops out on Midway Direct.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/theronmartian.jpg\"><img src=\"images/theronmartian.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron starts Martian Diagonal.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/peterfilm.jpg\"><img src=\"images/peterfilm.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Peter filming at Peshastin.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/theronmartian2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/theronmartian2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron on Martian Diagonal.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/kimmartian.jpg\"><img src=\"images/kimmartian.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Kim on Martian Diagonal.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/krismartian.jpg\"><img src=\"images/krismartian.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Kris on Martian Diagonal.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/therongibs.jpg\"><img src=\"images/therongibs.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Theron tops out on Gibson&#39;s Crack.</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/krisleads.jpg\"><img src=\"images/krisleads.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Kris leading on Mountaineer&#39;s Buttress.</i></p>\n"}
