{"date":"2005-11-6","title":"Rofanspitze","blurb":"fun hike","description":"<p>It took quite a\nwhile the night before to try and match up a hike that might be doable in bad\nweather, had maximum views, had the possibility of a loop trip, along with easy\ntrain access. In the winter (like, now), many buses to the mountains quit\nrunning. Or rather, they say &quot;see you for ski season!&quot; and I&#39;m in the wierd off\nperiod. Finally I decided to go to this place called The Brandenberg Alps, or\nthe Rofan Range. It&#39;s a compact, cute little &quot;range&quot;, with the high, snowy\nZillertel Alps to the south, and the imposing, rocky Karwendel Range to the\nwest.</p>\n<p>The train was fast, taking 1.5 hours to Jenbach. There, I thought to maybe walk\nto Maurach, but I got lazy and took a taxi. Had I known it would cost 14 Euros I\nmight have walked! It&#39;s only like 4 kilometers, and there was no traffic. That\ncab driver apparently had to make his whole morning on my fare. The cab dropped\nme off at the Rofanseilbahn, a lift that takes you some 800 meters up to the\nErfuhrter Hut. &quot;Es kostet 14 Euro&quot; said the dour woman. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back&quot; I\nsaid, and quickly snuck away to walk up. Seriously, cash goes through my hands\nlike water here, time to get a little more miserly.</p>\n<p>Apparently there was lots of snow up at the hut, and I thought that if it was\ntoo snowy for me to hike, at least I&#39;d make the 2500 foot hike up there. No\nsooner did I think this than did the steep trail start kicking my butt. But I\nstuck with it, and soon the foggy murk opened up a bit to see mountains around\nme. The rocks in the trail were so slippery, that it was like walking on ice. I\nwished for hiking poles for the first of many times that day.</p>\n<p>After an hour or so, I was standing at the hut: &quot;Erfuhrter Hutte geschlossen!&quot;\nsaid the sign. What? No busty waitresses and red-faced beer drinkers? There was\nanother restaurant but it looked expensive so I stayed away. I thought I could\nfill my water bottle in the bathroom, but it had a &quot;no drinking&quot; sign over the\nsink. I later wished I did it anyway, because it&#39;s silly to run a whole day on 3\ncups of water!</p>\n<p>So I wandered along a trail towards the Rofanspitze, following behind two rock\nclimbers. I wondered what they were going to do in the snow? Later I found out\nthat this little range is peppered with many rock climbs. On the hike, I mostly\nwandered among snowy hills, just seeing one big rock face called the\nRosskopf. But once on the summit of the Rofanspitze, I could see the north\nwalls, which fell steeply down to heather slopes. It reminded me of the first\ntime seeing the north walls of the southern Pickets after the &quot;relatively\ngentle&quot; (ha!) south side. These weren&#39;t as big, but they were even steeper. I\ndidn&#39;t feel my usual lust for the scariest looking face, but I enjoyed the\ndramatic view.</p>\n<p>The map showed a dotted line connecting high ridge points, and so I followed on\nthe crest of the ridge, which had some real &quot;wow&quot; moments. But I was disturbed\nby the slippery rocks and thin layer of snow. When the trail went down steeply,\nI had to be really careful. Hiking poles would have helped. So I left the high\nridge and followed trail around the south side of the Rosskopf. Climbing back\nup, I started encountering really steep exposed sections of trail that had\nlittle handlines. I was grateful under the current slippery conditions!</p>\n<p>&quot;Where are all the peeps?&quot; I thought. So far, it was like a hike in Washington, nobody around at all.</p>\n<p>I kept threading through and occasionally on the summits, finally deciding to\ncontinue my traverse to a place called Dalfazalm and then go down to the town. I\nwas getting pretty tired and thirsty for sure. Finally I saw another crazy\nperson out in this weather. We said hello. Or rather, I said &quot;Gross Gott!&quot; and\nhe said something, kind of a half-question (&quot;semmeln?&quot;). I wasn&#39;t ready for that\nso I just kept the smile frozen on my face and glid by. &quot;Damn&quot; I thought. Social\nencounters can be awkward with a language barrier, sigh.</p>\n<p>Back on my solitary way I entered my favorite part of the hike: a brown meadow\nwith impressive views out to the Karwendel. It was snowing lightly, and those\npeaks looked fierce. While around me was a picturesque valley, which I&#39;d love to\nfarm in if I lived in the year 1483.</p>\n<p>Below this I made my way without incident back to the Seilbahn station. Getting\nhome was tough, because although I found a bus, I still ended up waiting almost\n2 hours for the next train. &quot;I would have been home by now, if I had a car!&quot; I\nthought with some frustration. But eventually the train came, and then the\nnow-familiar U5 from Hauptbahnhof to good ol&#39; Friedenheimerstrasse and home.</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/innvalley.jpg\"><img src=\"images/innvalley.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Inn valley from the Rofanspitze</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/hochiss.jpg\"><img src=\"images/hochiss.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Hochiss seen from the Rofanspitze</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/karwendal.jpg\"><img src=\"images/karwendal.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The mighty Karwendal Range</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/erfurterhut.jpg\"><img src=\"images/erfurterhut.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Erfurter hut from the northwest</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/kotalm.jpg\"><img src=\"images/kotalm.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Kotalm seen from the Streichkopf</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/schermstein.jpg\"><img src=\"images/schermstein.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Looking down from the Grubascharte</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/spieljoch.jpg\"><img src=\"images/spieljoch.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Spieljoch has huge vertical cliffs</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/steephike.jpg\"><img src=\"images/steephike.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The handline was appreciated on the steep, slippery rocks!</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/branntenberg.jpg\"><img src=\"images/branntenberg.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Meadows near Dalfazalm</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/routepic.jpg\"><img src=\"images/routepic.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Some of my route</i>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n"}
