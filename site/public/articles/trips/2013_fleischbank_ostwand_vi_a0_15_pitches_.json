In 2006 Josef and I were\non the North Ridge of the Predigtstuhl and this wall looked steep and terrifying.\nAs we climbed our ridge we saw two puny figures lost in it. The final impetus\ncame when I read that the climb successfully done was like a Masters Thesis\nin alpine rock climbing. Okay...avid credentialist that I am...it must\nbelong to me!</p>\n<p>Note that only one of these motivations came from actual experience of\nthe rock...the rest were bits of fancy pieced together from wisps of text.\nAnd yet my will was iron-hard! Keep that in mind next time someone convinces\nyou of the rock-solid validity of his beliefs! (iron-hard, rock-solid?\nGod, I mean, can I hear myself?!?)</p>\n<p>In 2007 Daniel A. and I went in for it. The route is intimidating from\nthe get-go. You traverse in on a two pitch long slippery-looking ledge\nof scoops and unforgiving cliffs. Then, some hard moves in thin cracks\nand bits of polished face. Now Duelfer really shows you who is the boss.\nA bolt in an overhang lures you up, but it&#39;s nearly impossible to climb\nit. Finally we pulled on a sling. You think, &quot;If that was supposed to be\ngrade VI, what will happen to me above?!?&quot; Because there is a lot of above,\nat this point. The terrible traverse on pitch 6 looms in the mind, as do\nthe Exit Cracks. For Daniel and I, it was a sunny day, but frankly, the\nwall spit us off with pure intimidation.</p>\n<p>6 years later, Georg and I were back. It had been a terrible spring and\nsummer for people who like dry things. Not only rain, but snow into June\nat oddly low elevations! We hoped to redeem ourselves and live with confidence\nagain. &quot;How about the Duelfer Ostwand?&quot; I chirped. Georg was on board,\nand Saturday morning at 6:30 we were tromping up from the Wochenbrunner\nAlm with ropes and rack. I was so confident that my jacket was just a flimsy\npiece of plastic with a zipper. I&#39;m playing head games with the weather\ngod...the key is to show you are not afraid! Not for an instant!</p>\n<p>On the way up, Georg related a news story that was huge in Graz, where\nhe&#39;d been studying for a few months. As a way of illustrating how off-the-beaten-path\nthe Steiermark is, the most important news of the day was that a boy had\nthrown a backpack at another boy, and a pair of scissors flew out and impaled\nthe victim in the head! Amazingly, he was fine after surgery. Whew.</p>\n<p>But this was enough fuel for our imaginations to construct the echo of\na vast and terrible civilization that MUST live again! You see, the people\nof the Steiermark are strong, but wily. They will never approach the same\nway. Their hegemony of the hills and crags was maintained for thousands\nof years. They saw Rome rise and fall. They fought the Turks with ferocity,\nand prevailed. Who are these strange peoples? In the hurled backpack, we\ngain insight. A prejudicial anger at the world that never fully conforms\nto the Will must be strong. A delight in confusion, a &quot;hang-it-all&quot; freewheeling\napproach to the oppressive demands of society. Above all, a determination\nto prevail. All this can be divined as thoughts alive in the first boy.\nFor the first boy is a true Steiermarker! We should all rejoice in the\nabject display of mans intolerance of weakness!</p>\n<p>Um...okay, perhaps we got carried away. I guess in reality Steiermark\nis just an ordinary province with mostly good people. But by the time we&#39;d\nhiked to the Elmauer Tor, we were issuing press releases like the following:</p>\n<p>A.P. (Graz) - In a stunning discovery today, archeologists have discovered\nthat the entire Steiermarkian province rests on a vast underground cavern...filled,\nimprobably, with skulls. Local farmers expressed confusion and bemusement,\nbut few answers were forthcoming from these taciturn people of the hills.\nNevertheless, gates and tunnels which access the vast underground space\nwere found, and showed signs of recent use.</p>\n<p>So this goes way back. I mean...jeez. Frankly, we are all doomed if the\nSteiermark awakens to it&#39;s dormant power.</p>\n<p>But until then, we could hike together up still-thick snowfields at the\npass. We could look down the other side and see our Wall, occasionally\nobscured by cloud. We descended on rock, scree and snow, then carefully\nclimbed onto the ramp. Georg and I belay each other across for two pitches,\nfinding this easy terrain strangely intimidating just as Daniel and I did.\nBut this time we moved among wisps of fog, and looked to the sky with a\nflinching glance. Georg led up the tricky face, battling rock that felt\ngreasy even if it wasn&#39;t wet. Cracks were wet, but climbable. The biggest\nproblem from them was the intimation of a dark future: ever more wetter\ncracks to come! Already, we were succumbing to the whispered council of\nthe Wall. Grima Wormtongue! <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227560156/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5445/9227560156_8e287b47c8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg on pitch 5</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9224777511/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3748/9224777511_6ebae850e3_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>On pitch 6, approaching the traverse</em></p>\n<p>And now the overhand on pitch 4. I&#39;ve become a better rock climber in\nthe last 6 years, so surely I can climb it. But I was never wronger. I\nattached slings and aided like a good 1950s rock man. As Georg came up\nhe salved my ego wounds by also finding it very hard and making some use\nof aid too. We agreed it had nothing to do with grade VI, which was the\n&quot;free&quot; rating.</p>\n<p>So...we&#39;d insulating our minds successfully this time against the feeling\nthat somehow we should have been expected to climb that move free. Left\nunprotected against that idea, the mind would be eaten from within, and\nthe hand would tremble! Grima, again!</p>\n<p>Georg led a cool pitch in the mist, then I started up a steep crack, trying\nto avoid the wet parts. After a couple delicate moves, I was confronted\nwith a circus of fixed ropes and gear: the Terrible Traverse! With ambition\nto climb free, I clipped a fixed rope quite high, and confidently set out\nto the left, eventually realizing the route was 3 meters below me...doh!\nAfter spending about 30 seconds trying to figure out how to get down there,\nI just batmanned down the hanging fixed rope, losing the &quot;free climbed&quot;\nstatus pin. But then it was a really neat pitch: 20 meters of traverse\nprotected by a bolt, some pitons and some gear. Somehow there was always\na handhold right where you needed it, even though it was facing upside\ndown, or would only hold one finger. I moved cautiously because the rock\nstill felt greasy. Georg came over, looking alternately distracted and\nbemused, moving soundlessly in the gloomy fog.</p>\n<p>So if you want to climb it all free, just remember STAY LOW and go directly\nacross to the piton you&#39;ll see on your left as you top out of the steep\ncrack. Don&#39;t be lured by the welter of fixed gear 3 meters higher. You\nshould be able to protect the move by clipping the knot at the end of the\nhanging fixed line (though the rope is shredded...long intestines of unsheathed\ncore visibile...just sayin&#39;!).</p>\n<p>We kept climbing, both of us noticing that our legs were getting a bit\nwobbly. We had tired rather easily! And then we sat momentarily under a\ndripping overhang, having climbed over slime-encased rock that thankfully\nhad a few pointy bits sticking out for our rubber shoes. The sky darkened\nfurther, and in the dim half-light Georg set out across the Duelferstrasse.\nSome wag of an earlier age had executed the equivalent in climbing of the\nlampshade on the head party trick. A street sign was chained to the rock\nhere, hanging at a jaunty angle: &quot;<em>Duelferstrasse</em>.&quot; Heh.</p>\n<p>But there were neat traverse moves. &quot;They really liked to traverse and\nclimb down in the past,&quot; mused Georg, truthfully. Later, he was morally\noffended in the Exit Cracks that a much better climbing way had been ignored\nin favor of brutal vertical chimney and offwidth. &quot;All they had was the\nArm, and the Hammer.&quot; Georg is a ton of fun!</p>\n<p>We also realized that I&#39;d been unintentionally insincere in my German\npronunciation. If I was speaking English, then used a German word, I had\nthe habit of pausing before and after the word, and altering my voice somewhat.\nI intended to portray the sound of <em>italics</em>. &quot;I hope that the...<em>Ausstiegsrisse</em>...is\nnot too wet!&quot; Only after thinking about it a while, I realized that my\n&quot;italics voice&quot; was built on &quot;german tv commercial narrator voice,&quot; a pleasingly\nlow gravelly sound, with a hint of regionalism to convey authenticity.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, German folks think I&#39;m making fun of them when I do that!\nNo I&#39;m not...but now I understand...and will try to improve! Oh curse you\nGrima Fleischtongue! <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227549216/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7318/9227549216_8c308e04a8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>On the gloomy Duelferstrasse</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9224765489/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2824/9224765489_01877bd5bc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael &quot;crosses the street&quot;</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227544144/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7295/9227544144_5cfabf1abf_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Easy terrain and a break in the clouds</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227542202/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2850/9227542202_41655b532a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The &quot;easily impaled&quot; pitch</em></p>\n<p>But we continued...and the day gradually grew brighter from that darkest\npoint on the Duelferstrasse. Georg led one pitch with a unique death-trap.\nHe had to climb a strenuous overhang after standing on tip-toe on a series\nof dagger-like shards. If I didn&#39;t keep the rope very tight, a slip would\nimpale him! We are Serious Men, with Serious Problems!</p>\n<p>Now for the Exit Cracks. Sounds really cool to name it like that. Like,\nwe must be on the Eiger or something. The first one was very nice, Georg\nled up smoothly. There is plenty of protection, enough pitons and bolts\nthat I think Georg only placed one cam. The second pitch had an intimidating\nlook. A vertical chimney which narrowed to off-width. Then, friendlier\nterrain reminiscent of the previous pitch, but it was hard to see how to\nconnect the two. I started up, wasting some energy thrutching deep in the\ncrack when I probably should have stayed outside. One wall was wet, and\nsome of the cracks were slimy. The Worm was at work again on my mind.</p>\n<p>I kept going to the point where you can either escape to the left or continue\nup the off-width. I tried left, but with my feet pasted on a 60 degree\nslab, and one greasy handhold at the same angle, I gave up. I rested here\non the rope a moment, then tried to the right. I scoped out some footholds\nin the wet crack, and had a very good (if wet) handhold. Begin thrutching...a\nform of climbing where the most important thing is to grunt and tense every\nmuscle! I inched up, realizing I could rest if I tensed my splayed frog-legs...I\nwould be held pinned like a bug by the tender embrace of the chimney! But\nno long stops...keep going. Finally a dry handhold outside the crack, and\nrelief and escape to a ledge on the left.</p>\n<p>Here I panted like some kind of farm animal for a full five minutes. Georg&#39;s\nmoral outrage at the ridiculous line of Arm and Hammer simmered below.\nFinally I continued, enjoying the climbing so much because I knew I&#39;d passed\nthrough the eye of the needle for this particular climb...bruised but still\nstanding. I placed a cam, clipped a bolt, slung a chockstone. I belayed\nGeorg up. The clouds parted as I did so. A ray of sun turned a far away\nmeadow fluorescent green. The valley below was visible, with tiny ant-like\nmen moving on their tedious missions. An alien civilization would never\naccuse them of being here for fun. Certainly they were after resources\nto eat, or certain small stones to use in religions rituals. On the latter,\nI guess they&#39;d be correct. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227529264/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7381/9227529264_0c57bebc80_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael in the Exit Crack</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9224742407/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7338/9224742407_9b9b52dd49_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>End of the difficulties!</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227518826/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5515/9227518826_dda0a9d4ae_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Totenkirchl</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9227517030/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7395/9227517030_252631fff1_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg, well-pleased</em> <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/9224781411/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2888/9224781411_2158c13794_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Wilder Kaiser in a gloomy mood</em></p>\n"}
