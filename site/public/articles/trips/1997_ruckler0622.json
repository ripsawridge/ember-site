However, circumstances fought me tooth and nail to prevent me\nfrom going, finally settling by allowing me to go, but ensuring a\nmiserable time!</p>\n<p>June was a very busy month for Kris and I. We visited friends in\nCalifornia, then had my parents come for two weeks, all the while\njuggling difficult schedules and barely sleeping. Writing this on the\n29th, with my parents safely home in Texas, and a flurry of\ngear-buying activity winding down, with Kris sound asleep upstairs,\nwith many obligations discharged, I can really breath a sigh of\nrelief. The month has been a success!</p>\n<p>My excuse for leaving Kris and my parents at home last Sunday despite\nominous clouds and rain was that I needed to try out the Asolo plastic\nboots I planned to rent for the AAI course in July. (See the\nSt. Helens report for a description of the pain caused by ill-fitting\nboots!) There was absolutely no other day available until that trip,\nso it had to be today, despite the weather. I required a long,\ncommitting hike, to make sure I got the kind of miles required to see\nif the shin-banging pains developed. Ruckle Ridge, as a 9-mile loop,\nup the ridge and down Ruckle Creek seemed perfect. I took all my\nraingear and arrived at the campground at 12:30 PM, getting a very\nlate start because Kris needed the car for her flute lesson that\nmorning.</p>\n<p>I began ascending immediately, plastic boots clunking awkwardly,\nfeeling rather foolish in them. I found solace in the thought that I\nmust be a serious outdoorsman to go through this just to test\nequipment! But I was excited about the ridge coming up. Emerging from\nthe trees at Buck Point, I admired the view and continued to an\nexciting talus slope and went directly up it. Real climbing began at\nthe top as I used tree roots and rocks to pull myself upward. The rest\nof the ridge would have this character: hard-won elevation gain\nthrough arm and leg muscle power, dismaying elevation losses, and lots\nof the-top-is-just-over-that-rise feelings. Oh, and lots of freezing\nrain and wind, by the way.</p>\n<p>Once I was properly on the breathtaking Ridge, with rocky cairns and\ndrop-offs to the right and left the rain began. It traveled\nhorizontally from right to left, coming from a big cloudbank at\neye-level one ridge to the west. I could see this cloud moving towards\nme, seeming to lose shape as it crossed an intervening valley. The\nwind was fierce, knocking me off balance with the heavy pack and\nclunky boots. As it picked up I passed two descending day-hikers, both\nof whom stared at my boots. I think one of them snickered, but it may\nhave been the wind.</p>\n<p>The boots were doing well, although they rubbed my ankles the wrong\nway. Still they were much better than the Koflach boots from\nSt. Helens. By 4:30, after 4 hours of hard, non-stop climbing, I knew\nI had to call it quits. I had planned to be home by 7, and knew that\nif I descended, I might not make it until 8:30 as it was. I really\ndidn&#39;t want to descend by the Ridge, since it would be as difficult\ngoing down as up.  But for safety&#39;s sake, I did. The frustrating part\nwas that I had been above the treeline of the ridges on my right and\nleft for some time, but the top of my ridge never appeared.</p>\n<p>Cold, wet, and defeated, I turned back. The latter part of the ascent\nhad been gentler forested slopes with occasional rock-and-root\nscrambling. I made good progress here, running where applicable. The\nmiddle elevation was marked by numerous scrambling passages with near\nfalls, tripping, and slips on wet rock. I think this section did take\nas long going down as it had going up. The lower slope, below the\ntalus section was regular steep trail hiking with switchbacks. By this\ntime, my legs were wobbly and I was very tired.</p>\n<p>It added up to an 8 hour day with no more than a half-hour of\ncumulative breaks, just constant movement against time and cold. The\ntrip was worthwhile however, providing that special handful of magical\nviews of mist in the valley on the descent.  Clouds of mist far below\ndid wonders for my time-panicked, worrisome brain.</p>\n"}
