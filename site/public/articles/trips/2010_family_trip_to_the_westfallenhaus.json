Kris and I schemed to keep\nthe cost down. Membership in the alpine club made lodging half price, but\ndinner and breakfast was still pretty expensive. In the end, by bringing\nour own breakfast we got in and out for about 60 euros. Not bad for a family\nof four for dinner, board and lunch the next day. We also had our own room.\nNext time we&#39;ll save more by sleeping in the common room, but the boys\nwere so enchanted with their bunk beds!</p>\n<p>There was a lot of traffic leaving the city, but eventually we were in\nLÃ¼sens and making an early afternoon hike. The weather was beautiful, but\na bit cold, and fresh snow decorated the peaks from about 2900 meters elevation.</p>\n<p>The boys were good hikers, but prone to sudden bouts of extreme tiredness.\nIt took something interesting to wake them up. Once I ate some berries\nand tried to get them to try them too. They were blueberries, and that\ngot us through a steep section.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854143568/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4854143568_d83e87a3cb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We found a good picnic place on a knoll and ate looking across at the\nwaterfalls I&#39;d climbed in previous winters. Kris made delicious salami\nsandwiches, and a tubular container of Pringles (TM) was a great idea.\nThe boys played with their Lego men a bit. These are a great idea...if\neach kid is allowed to bring two Lego men, it is enough of a toy to satisfy\nthem the whole weekend. The man can be placed in a natural environment\nof rock and heather, where he can experience alien attack, avalanche, menacing\nhelicopters, and all manner of similar fun!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853535073/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4853535073_efc5a135ab.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853534137/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4853534137_a6d9e49d4a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854158144/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4854158144_5e9382e99e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We rounded a corner then made a long pleasant traversing hike up to the\nWestfallenhaus, which looked impossibly distant. Sheep grazed the mountain\nabove us. We arrived in late afternoon, and immediately booked a private\nroom. The boys fell in love with the bunkbeds, and we all hung out in our\nbeds for an hour or so. Kris invented a game where the boys had to leave\nthe room, then come in and find where she&#39;d hidden a Lego man. That was\ngreat fun.</p>\n<p>We had dinner, then walked around the hut, where the boys found a dog\nto play with, and we all munched on cookies. As it got dark, we went in\nand went to bed, the boys so happy in their top bunks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854162906/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4854162906_ff399e74e9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854164596/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4854164596_ddce62efaa.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Early in the morning I woke up, put on contact lenses, grabbed my iPod\nand a candy bar, and snuck out to hike up the Schoentalspitze. I think\nit took 1.5 hours up, and there was snow on the summit block that had to\nbe negotiated. A cold wind competed with the weak morning sun on top, and\nthe view made me linger. Getting my fill, I hurried down, sometimes running\nthanks to some good loud music that fit the trail. Back at the hut we ate\nbreakfast, and I took the kids for a nature hike while Kris relaxed in\na sun chair. We found a big boulder and set up a space station on top,\npiling smaller rocks as places to hide. Then I napped in the meadow while\nthe wars raged on between various factions of a broken alliance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854168034/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4854168034_56b04d18f9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853552841/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4853552841_0a4ddc831f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853558227/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4853558227_d48446dfd2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853559877/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4853559877_0e06987ff6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854179784/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4854179784_5eb05a9b3b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4854181332/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4854181332_a41dab1656.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853564715/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4853564715_c8603d374d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853566237/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4853566237_acf3517e78.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>It was time to head down! At the hut I played guitar for a while, teaching\na little girl how to play the all important &quot;power chord.&quot; We hiked down,\ndoling out treats of chocolate when things got boring. Kris invented the\n&quot;no pooping on (a surprising object)&quot; game, which still entertains us regularly!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853571115/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4853571115_873a324860.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853574689/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4853574689_6903ff556a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4853576119/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4853576119_11ba3e0550.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We stopped in Garmisch for a couple hours of swimming on the way home.\nI jumped off the high-dive and landed funny, such that my teeth hurt for\nan hour! The boys loved the slides.</p>\n<p>It was a great first-overnight hike!</p>\n"}
