This\nvery interesting peak isn&#39;t mentioned in the normally comprehensive\nCascade Alpine Guide, but it probably should be. Mount Kent presents a\nsteep north facing wall to drivers on interstate 90. It is visible\njust east of McClellan&#39;s Butte, and is just as impressive in it&#39;s\nway. I first heard about the peak when Phil F. and Dave B. climbed a\nsteep line\nlast January. They also reported that Dallas Kloke made the first\nascent of the face in 1994 via an &quot;obvious gully.&quot; We also knew that\nEric Hoffman had climbed a gully on the east face and named it \n&quot;Eric&#39;s\nCouloir.&quot;</p>\n<p>We didn&#39;t bring a rope, and just figured we&#39;d find the easiest way up.\nAs it turned out we both forgot our watches, so we spent a lot more\ntime than we should have! We quickly hiked to the logging road that\ncrosses the McClellan&#39;s Butte trail, and turned left. The bushwhack up\nAlice Creek didn&#39;t look appealing, so we continued on a spur which\nobligingly entered the valley below the face. We dropped down when the\nroad ended and crossed Alice Creek, heading straight up for a nice\nlooking gully on the left side of the north face. As we climbed it, we\nthought it might be Eric&#39;s Gully, but later found that was further to\nthe east. In times of avalanche hazard, this would be a dangerous\nplace, as debris filled the whole basin, and the couloir in\nparticular.</p>\n<p>We climbed without crampons, though occasionally they would have been\nhelpful on the chunky debris buried under a covering layer of\nsnow. The angle was a pretty steady 45 to 50 degrees. The couloir is\nentered at about 3600 feet and climbed to a headwall blocking the way\nat 4200 feet. Here we traversed left 50 feet to steep but forested\nslopes that gained a ridge. From here we kept climbing to a false\nsummit at 4700 feet, with the true summit a quarter mile away at 5087\nfeet. Even without watches we knew we should head back from our &quot;Dawn\nPatrol&quot; morning trip!</p>\n<p>We climbed down and enjoyed an awesome 600 foot glissade down the\ncouloir.  We continued down to the valley bottom and hiked directly to\nthe road along Alice Creek. The easiest way is to stay on the west\nside of the creek and piece together open areas. Travel near the creek\nis more tedious, so if you can stay 50-100 feet above it is\nquicker. We named the gully the &quot;Dawn Couloir,&quot; and it seems to be a\ngreat way up or down the mountain, provided snow conditions are\nstable.</p>\n"}
