{"date":"2000-6-10","title":"Prusik Peak West Ridge","description":"<ul>\n<li><p>June 10-11, 2000</p>\n<p>&quot;Ow!&quot; In a flash of unpleasant clarity, I&#39;d had an idea. Let&#39;s climb\nPrusik Peak before overnight permits are required. Sure we&#39;ll have snow\neverywhere, but that didn&#39;t stop Beckey who climbed it in May for\ncripes sake! We all rearranged our plans a little bit, then spent the\nweek festering about what to take and what to leave. A stove was reluctantly\nbrought because we might not have running water at Lake Viviane, our\nintended camp spot. Crampons were left behind. Two rope teams of two,\neach with 60 meter ropes. The participants were:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve - claims to have a hip injury. Smokes us all on the approach.</li>\n<li>Jake - Expert mountain climber. He forgot his helmet and his sleeping pad.</li>\n<li>Peter - Can recite most of &quot;the Holy Grail.&quot; Willing to jump into snowy lakes.</li>\n<li>Michael - Devious in the extreme. Not above stealing food. Will put rocks in your pack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Musical director John Bennett was scheduled to appear at our camp, sing a few\nquatrains, and head down in the morning while we climbed.</p>\n<p>We were hiking before 8 am, but it already felt hot n&#39; dusty on the first\nswitchbacks. At two miles, we paused to admire the Snow Creek Wall, \nstrangely empty of climbers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/exitchim.jpg\" alt=\"Exit Chimney: The final obstacle on the climb.\">\n<img src=\"images/inchim1.jpg\" alt=\"Jake negotiating the chimney.\">\n<img src=\"images/inchim2.jpg\" alt=\"Peter about to come to grips with the chimney.\">\n<img src=\"images/jtower2.jpg\" alt=\"Jake coming around the mountain when he comes.\">\n<img src=\"images/mantels.jpg\" alt=\"Peter in a nice granite corner.\">\n<img src=\"images/panprus.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of the view below the final pitch.\">\n<img src=\"images/petersum.jpg\" alt=\"Peter on the summit.\">\n<img src=\"images/priest.jpg\" alt=\"The High Priest, the Boxtop and Mt.

They had set\noff a slab avalanche near the top of the pass, scaring them enough to\nwalk out the Snow Lake trail and hitch back to their car. They put to\nrest any illusions we had of climbing the peak today. It took them 12\nhours from base to base! 2 hours just for nasty steep snow without an ice\nax, or boots. We bid them farewell, and they chuckled about the cardboard\nstrapped to Jake. He had fashioned apple boxes into a poor sleeping pad.</p>\n<p>Victory at Nada Lake, \nwe were finally getting somewhere! We irritated\nPeter by refusing to walk back and pose by the lake. He &quot;gets a lot of\ncrap&quot; for taking landscape pictures, and apparently he&#39;s &quot;tired of taking\nthat crap&quot; so he tried to finagle a body into every photo. He pantomimed\na few incidents where &quot;crap&quot; was dispensed and unwillingly taken.</p>\n<p>At Snow Lake we had a long rest, and Peter almost jumped into the water.  He\ncontemplated a bouldering problem far out in the lake, and we urged him on as\ntrue friends should. But then we fell asleep and lost interest. I ate a sardine,\nand couldn&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t throw up.  I actually liked it.</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, we put our boots back on and climbed to Lake Viviane,\nnearly giving up halfway. The trail was steep and difficult to keep track\nof among the snowbanks, brush and slabs. Some of us felt kind of\nqueasy. Luckily, Jake got his second wind, and forged ahead with\nnew energy, finding the way to camp, then planning a climb of Little Annapurna\n(&quot;A Woman&#39;s Place&quot;) across the Enchantments. We all refused to accompany\nhim, but he did get me to scout the approach with him. We kicked steps\nin the snow that we could use in the frozen morning. We climbed up,\nthen over to the west, looking for better views. The mountain was spectacular!\nThe appearance from the west is divine, while from the southeast it&#39;s just\na jumble of blocks. How long I&#39;ve seen this view in photographs, I couldn&#39;t\nbelieve we were actually here. And this whole enchanted valley belonged to\nus. The only tracks we saw were from the party of three, and these were\nmelting in the sun.</p>\n<p>Back at camp, we said hello to the &quot;Kamp Goat&quot; who circled around with a\ncurious smile. He was losing his winter coat, and had a distinctive bald patch\non his neck. We jealously guarded our boots, knowing he would want them!</p>\n<p>Peter shared summer sausage and a neat wax container of cheese with me.\nJake and Steve tried to sleep, but Peter and I (both 29) carried on a conversation\ntypical of our generation:</p>\n<p> &quot;Did you have a snowspeeder?&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Yes&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Did you have the Degobah playset?&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Of course!&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;I never had Luke in Hoth attire, did you?&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Oh yeah, also Han Solo. Yoda was a quality figure, you got a\ncane, a cloak, a snake and a tool belt.&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Yes, and IG-88 had an awesome gun. I nearly wet myself when I\ngot the Millennium Falcon.&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;I know I did!&quot;</p>\n<p>This went on until the goat came and stared us down. When he\nleft we started up again, on another favorite topic. Steve and\nJake endured us stoically.</p>\n<p> &quot;We are the Knights who say...KNIE!&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;We shall use my larger scales!&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;It&#39;s not a question of how &#39;e grips it, it&#39;s a simple matter of\nweight ratios!&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Did you get my note?&quot;</p>\n<p> &quot;Er, I got A note...&quot;</p>\n<p>I laughed way too hard and loud at the old Monty Python lines, \nprompting another visit by the\ngoat who flashed his curious smile and dead, coal black eyes.</p>\n<p>The first half of &quot;sleep&quot; was marked by sweat, claustrophobia,\nand &quot;soft spots&quot; on my skull that complained about the rock I used\nas a pillow. Finally, I took off the sweater, hat and extra shirt I\nthought I needed, and lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>We reluctantly awoke to the tiny 4:30 wrist alarms. Jake had\nsurvived the night on cardboard, mistaking his arm for a meaty \nsea-creature when the whole thing fell asleep. I played &quot;Contact/Crumb\nJamboree&quot; in my sleeping bag in an unfortunate Pop-Tart/eye-wear debacle.\nPeter felt better, probably regretting giving up so much of that\nsummer sausage. We stomped up a hill, down and steeply up towards the\nmountain. Our pre-fabricated boot steps were nice to have, as the\nsnow had hardened considerably. I thought about the route and all\nthe slightly conflicting beta we had acquired. Steve was going strong,\nnever even mentioning his injured hip. He had totally turned the\nsituation around. By getting out and climbing, the injury seemed to\nhave disappeared!</p>\n<p>We roped up at the balanced rock, setting a belay at a wizened tree\n20 feet above. I moved up, suddenly confused by the jumble of black\nand tan rock. First there was a crack with the lichen scraped off by\nhundreds of padding feet. After that, it was as if every climber had\ntaken a different route. &quot;Okay, fine!&quot; I thought, doing the same.\nAround a boulder, up on top, to the left, no more rope. I have the\nuncanny ability to run out of any amount of rope you give me, and now\nI&#39;d done it with a 60 meter rope. Struggling 7 more feet, and I had\na big picnic table rock to squat &#39;n scratch on. I reeled in a \nbusiness-like Steve, and surrendered the rack. He padded around a bulge,\nclipping an old fixed sling. Within seconds he was at the 5.7\nfriction pitch, so often mentioned for it&#39;s (oooh!) &quot;12 foot runout&quot;.\nAfter two moves, he was on the crest placing a cam.</p>\n<p>Peter was fiddling with protection at a crux move below. He made the\nmove and joined me, happy with his first wilderness lead. Just to\nannoy our companions, we switched ropes, and Peter followed Steve\nup, giving me a chance to belay again. He left me his rack, festooned\nwith hexes and tied slings. Jake bellied up to the bar, and I took\noff. A bouldery hop across a 12 foot chasm was an unexpected move before\nthe friction pitch. I clipped the iron piton at the base, didn&#39;t find\nanything for my gear, and started up. A good but thin hold for the left\nhand, tiny nubbins for the feet, and the slab&#39;s edge for the right hand\nencouraged me. Two more steps and I crouched at the top. Fumbling\nwith the unfamiliar rack, I placed a forged friend, and steadfastly\nrefused to look down and right. But the hungry maw looked at me!\nWhistling as I worked, I climbed to a bulging tower, and traversed\naround the south on an easy ledge. On the other side, I straddled the\nridge crest, &quot;riding&quot; my way to flat ground. There was a lot of rope\ndrag here, but the climbing was easy. I just yanked about 5 feet of\nrope at a time, paying it out as I moved forward.</p>\n<p>Peter had attempted to girdle the peak on a long traverse, perhaps\nimagining a first corkscrew ascent. He was reeled back and sent upward,\nto find the elusive &quot;highest easy ledge&quot; Beckey mentions. Meanwhile,\nJake was out-of-sight, dealing with inner demons on the friction slab.\nHe was able to get a very high &quot;body friction&quot; coefficient, and\nsuccessfully emerged around the corner, only to be mobbed by the\npaparazzi intent on photos by the hundreds. He suitably &quot;worked it&quot;\nfor the camera and skootched across the shark fin ridge.</p>\n<p>I climbed up to Peter&#39;s ledge, admiring his hand-crafted gear anchor.\nHe used the yellow Alien, thus preserving it&#39;s record of getting\nused on every climb. I wouldn&#39;t go anywhere without my little yellow\nAlien! Soon the four of us milled around on the ledge, Jake and\nI inadvertently playing &quot;see-saw&quot; on a tottering block. It was Steve&#39;s\nlead on what looked to be the hardest and best part of the climb.\nWe watched in rapt attention as he jammed up to a ledge, traversed\nto a dihedral and sunk some gear. His &quot;mantel&quot; onto another ledge was\nsomething to see. His most private aspects were slowly crushed by\na knot of carabiners and the unforgiving granite. Sadly, the\ncamera was put away. Mental note: don&#39;t let that happen to me!\n(note from Steve: &quot;I want to set the record straight:<br>My mantel was a paragon of grace!&quot;)</p>\n<p>Stoically, he forged on, just out of sight, finally coming to the\n &quot;5.4&quot; chimney. Someone may be able to prove we were off route, but\nthis was the only obvious chimney around. Steve got a good cam in\nat the base, then was confounded by the maneuvers required to get\nhigher. We listened to his ice ax bang listlessly on the granite\nwall above as he cycled through different postures. He called on\n &quot;The Inner Ron Kauk&quot; and forced our hand. Now there was no retreating,\nour leader had gained the pinnacl&#39;d point of Prusik! In a flurry of\nactivity, Peter climbed, avoiding the traverse by starting at the\ndihedral&#39;s base. I followed, getting a belay from Jake below. As\nPeter pantomimed patiently past protection points, he purposefully\nleft what Steve had placed there, only the hour before. \nChurlishly, I purloined the pre-placed pieces for my pink-point\nascent. Peter hollered some advice to me about a pendulum and a\nflake. Steve hollered some advice to me about a chimney and\na left foot. I just kept climbing. Peter got some pictures of me\non a fun flake, and I got a picture of him in the chimney. With\nadvice from our chimney expert above, Peter nicely climbed up.\nI moved into it, clipped to a good cam and started up. A strenuous\nmove with a poor right foot, and a tenuous hand jam allowed me\nto paw at loose rocks near the chimney exit. I made use of Steve&#39;s advice, \nwedging my shoulders\ninto the chimney. It was very secure, in fact, I could have dangled\nmy feet uselessly, and still felt great.</p>\n<p>In summary, this final obstacle will really get your blood flowing,\nespecially with a pack filled with boots, ice ax, etc. Don&#39;t laugh at\nme when I say it felt like 5.8. Ok, fine...laugh.</p>\n<p>Now it was Jake&#39;s turn, and just when we were relaxing and unroping at\nthe summit, he was in flight below us! Steve and Peter looked at me\nin disbelief when I said &quot;Jake just pendulumed across the face!&quot;\n &quot;I didn&#39;t even feel it!&quot; said Steve, or something like that.\nA moment later, Jake said he was ok, but he did hit his knee pretty hard.\nHe had tried a 5.13 variation before the final ledge, and found himself\ninstantly airborne. Amazingly, he climbed back up, let me haul his pack,\nthen climbed the chimney so quickly we all felt ashamed of our groveling\nperformance. Ignoring our amazement and offers of sponsorship, Jake moved\nto the summit, and we crowded around his knee. It was swollen, which\nworried us all. It must have hurt a lot.</p>\n<p>Okay, so now our mood was \n<em>&quot;gosh-what-a-great-place-we-did-it-wow-but-we-should-hurry-down-before-that-knee-stiffens-up&quot;</em>. We\ntook a lot of pictures, and I signed the summit register for all of\nus. Peter said each party member had to put their signature instead,\notherwise it &quot;didn&#39;t count&quot;. We read a note in there that this guy\nfrom Wenatchee had solo climbed the route in 19 minutes. He also made\nsure to write down how quickly he soloed Dragontail and one or two\nother peaks.</p>\n<p>Steve threw the ropes, and disappeared over the north side. Rappelling\non two 60 meter ropes, he made it a long way down to some slings. Jake\nwas next, then Peter and I.  &quot;So long!&quot; I said, sure I wouldn&#39;t\nvisit this place for few years at least.  I liked the summit, there\nwas room to camp up there, it was nice and sunny, and the incredible\nexposure of the south face acts as an air conditioner: a cold sweat\nalways results from a look down there.</p>\n<p>At the station, I changed into my boots, since we were going through\nincreasing amounts of snow. Later, to pass the time at the rappel\nstations, Peter and I had a rousing game of paper, rock,\nscissors. Then he made up some rabbit, carrot, gun game, but I beat\nhim at that too. Pulling the rope after the second rappel, a\nmoderately sized rock came down on us. It was about the size of a\npaperback. We didn&#39;t know this though, and Steve&#39;s cries of &quot;Rock!&quot;\nchanging to &quot;Big Rock! Big Rock!&quot; caused me to try and burrow under\nPeter. It was coming straight for Steve, but landed harmlessly in the\nsnow 3 inches from Peter and I. Now we all worried about Jake&#39;s head,\nthe only one unprotected by plastic.  When I looked at him, it seemed\nto get bigger by the second, attracting rocks with a fierce\ngravitational pull. One more half rappel, and we stood on a steep\nsnowy ledge. Wow! I was glad we brought our ice axes.  Peter stuffed\n400 feet of rope into his pack to relieve Jake. He was doing great,\nfiguring out how to walk so the knee injury didn&#39;t slow him down too\nmuch.</p>\n<p>We carefully traversed the snow, coming out near the base of the\nroute. Some more scrambling, and we began the descent to camp. The\nsnow was too soft to glissade, so long plunge steps got us there\nquickly. I rescued our gear from the tree, then fell into a stupor of\npleasure consuming my last half sandwich. I had carried a bulky\nTupperware case to protect them, so it was as fresh and unsquashed as\nwhen Kris made it for me. Contrast this with the mystery &quot;tomato or\nbread?&quot; questions Jake had to ask of his sandwich, and the debauched\nhelplessness of Peter&#39;s once-proud peanut butter sandwiches. Total\nfailure of bread/innards integrity.  I couldn&#39;t poke fun at Steve&#39;s\nsandwiches because he went the whole day on two Fig Newtons, and I\nthink he coughed one of those up. Too dry.</p>\n<p>We packed up, each carrying more to offer Jake some relief. We said\ngoodbye to the goat, and soon raced down the snow slopes towards Snow\nLake. I found a cache of cairns we had missed on the way up, but they\nled nowhere. Cursing, I followed Steve back up, crossing a waterfall\nand rotten snow. This part of the trail went very quickly. Jake got\nanother tick. We each fell down into rotten snow holes. Finally, we\ngot to the lake and made the endless traverse around it. At the dam,\nwe had a long rest, where I consumed everyone&#39;s remaining food. I ate\nsardines, powerbars, goo, candy bars - basically anything nobody else\nwanted. (note from Steve: <em>&quot;At the dam, Michael went\ninto such a frenzy of eating, that I was concerned that he had started\nto channel Euel Gibbons and would continue gorging on bark and pine\ncones, and denude the entire forest!&quot;</em>) I was\nfeeling ok, but trying not to think of the 6+ miles we had to go. It\nmust have been about 5:30 pm. The trip down to Nada Lake was pretty\nnice. I enjoyed the view of Steve and Jake bouncing far ahead on the\ntrail, and Peter taking great interest in the flowers behind.</p>\n<p>Actually, the switchbacks above the lake brought a rare moment of\npeace for me. Looking down on the lake, nestled among trees and steep\ncanyon walls, I didn&#39;t want to move, just stare at it until the sun\nwent down. Peter seemed to share this feeling, and for a brief time,\nwe could smile without worrying about the many miles to go, on already\naching feet. Brian Burdo said in one of his guidebooks &quot;When it comes\nto happiness, 95\\% of success is just slowing up.&quot;  At the lake,\nPeter noticed a grand waterfall we had missed on the way up. I tried\nto get water from the lake, but a stringy worm twitched in my\nbottle. No rest for the wicked!</p>\n<p>Down, down, down in growing darkness. I hadn&#39;t seen Steve or Jake in a\nlong time, so Peter and I were sticking together. He had at least one\nbig blister, and each step hurt a lot.  Finally, Steve was waiting for\nus, explained that he needed to hurry and get back for an 8 am meeting\nin Oregon. We raced ahead, leaving Peter and his blister to a private\ntrail of tears. I remembered my own &quot;trail of tears&quot;. Four miles\nalong the white river in full-shank heavy boots. Steve had raced ahead\nto escape the bugs. I wallowed in misery, wearing all my goretex in\nthe stifling heat, hundreds of mosquitoes frantically trying to\npuncture the seal. I didn&#39;t even want to look at my feet. Finally, I\nreached bottom, sitting down by the river in a puddle of deer\nurine. Steve&#39;s car reeked for months. I now have a bone spur at the\nsite of that horrible heel blister.</p>\n<p>We found Jake at the car just at full dark, around 10 pm. Feeling\npretty good, I prepared to climb back up and take Peter&#39;s pack. But\nlo! A figure staggers up in the dark, only 15 minutes behind us! He\nhadn&#39;t even sat in deer urine. I was impressed, I certainly would have\nfound some.</p>\n<p>We went from &quot;beer for all!&quot; to &quot;how about a meal at least?&quot; to\n&quot;I&#39;m just going home.&quot; as the day went on. Four sleepy, exhausted\nbodies motored over the pass to the west, where all the people live.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notes-from-john-bennett\">Notes from John Bennett</h2>\n<p><em>This side-story is from fellow climber John Bennett, who tried to\nmeet up with us on the Snow Creek trail. Considering his generosity to\nthese climbers, and the time that took, it wasn&#39;t meant to be. But he\nsaved the day with an interesting tale and a restorative hike to the\nSnow Creek Wall.</em></p>\n<p>It all started when I decided to get up really early and head out to\nLeavenworth from Seattle. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t leave Seattle until\n9:30. I was on my way to a trail-head up Icicle Creek when I noticed\nthree hitch hikers, one going down the canyon and two going up. They\nlooked pretty tired and I said to myself, &quot;man I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not those\nguys&quot;. Upon reaching the trail-head I saw a sign that said you needed\na trail head park pass and noticed that I the gazillion passes I have\nwouldn&#39;t work and I would have to go to the store and buy yet another\npass. For a moment I sat in my car thinking gee, I really need to\ndevelop a project plan with milestones, critical path, key activity\ndrivers, sponsor list, process flow, budget, and of course a RACI\n(responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) chart to maintain all\nthe different passes I need to acquire in a year to go outside on a\nweekend and not think about work. I never knew how complex it is to go\nfor a walk. Finally I decided the right thing to do is to buy another\npass.</p>\n<p>On my way down the canyon I decided to pick up one of the hitch\nhikers, he said he needed to get to a phone because is party was a day\nlate in checking in. During the ride he mentioned that he was coming\nback from Prusik Peak and I told him I was going to hook up with some\nof my buddies just below Prusik and camp out with them.  The\nhitchhiker perked up and said his group had met up with another group\nand it was probably my friends. I was really psyched he met up with my\nfriends until he said, &quot;Man do those guys have a long day in front of\nthem&quot;! Just then every lazy cell in my brain perked up and thought\n&quot;long day, no one said anything about a long day&quot;.</p>\n<p>By noon I was on my way back up the canyon and was rolling into the\nparking lot when I saw the other two hitchhikers and realized they\nwere in the same party with the guy I picked up earlier and I decided\nto give them a ride as well. They needed to go back to Colchuck Lake\ntrail-head and my hiking brain cells were saying, &quot;we really need to\nstart hiking&quot; of course my lazy brain cells we saying &quot;we&#39;re doing a\ngood deed and the trail can wait&quot; (convincing little brain cells\naren&#39;t they). During the ride back to Colchuck trail head they were\ndiscussing how light my friends were going and how the crux on the\nlast pitch is well understated in the Beckey guide. By the time I made\nit back to the lower trail head it was closer to 1:00 and figured\nthere was no way I would catch up with Michael and the gang until very\nlate and decided to hike a few miles, have lunch and mosey on back to\nSeattle. Not very exciting but I had a wonderful time helping out some\nclimbers and enjoying the beautiful weather.</p>\n"}
