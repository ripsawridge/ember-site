The weather was not great\nSaturday, so we took umbrellas and planned to spend the walk to the hut in the\nrain. But the forecast for Sunday was excellent. At the last minute, the boys\nbrought their buddy Nick (Nicolau) along. We got a late start from the\nGramaialm, first eating a hearty lunch as it rained. The boys discovered a great\ntrampoline and got completely soaked.</p>\n<p>We hiked up, and gradually the rain stopped. A real bonus of the poor weather\nwas a wealth of salamanders along the trail. The boys got really good at seeing\nthem hiding in the grass right along the edges. We picked up and petted so many\nof them!</p>\n<p>We went into the Lamsenjochhuette for dinner. It was quite crowded, but the meal\nwas good. After dinner the boys played for a while, and Kris and I thought about\ngoing into the bar once the kids fell asleep but honestly we were too tired. We\nfell right asleep!</p>\n<p>In the morning, I took the boys up the little peak right next to the hut. At the\nend it was quite steep, and we had to be careful! But we found a little hidden\nbasin, and made it a &quot;secret spot.&quot; We took off shoes, ate a candy bar, and made\nplans to come back here sometime and sleep overnight. Actually the peak was a\nsubpeak of the Schafj√∂chl (2157 m).</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403401689'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3852/14403401689_02daf3fa2b_b.jpg'></a>\nSalamanders!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403552598'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2931/14403552598_dcd5b4a543_b.jpg'></a>\nMade it!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403731637'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2896/14403731637_e742bec23e_b.jpg'></a>\nHiking up the Schafjoechl.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14610244063'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3862/14610244063_1c6854c607_b.jpg'></a>\nView of the hut and Lamsenspitze.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14589468622'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3904/14589468622_ab6161ede3_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the Schafjoechl</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14590162105'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3841/14590162105_940a1abf2a_b.jpg'></a>\nN. loves the view.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403585849'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5520/14403585849_ca35e7eed0_b.jpg'></a>\nElijah fooling around</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14567141496'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3858/14567141496_21cf491d80_b.jpg'></a>\nBoys with Lamsenspitze</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403529680'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5482/14403529680_8e9c82a91f_b.jpg'></a>\nOn our way to the Westliche Lamsenjoch</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403577288'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3896/14403577288_cbb222d87c_b.jpg'></a>\nA kid in the mountains</p>\n<p>Coming carefully down, we met Kris and decided to hike to the Westliche\nLamsenjoch and to the summit of the Hannkampl (2080 m) before hitting the\nGramaialm Hochleger for lunch. There are huts everywhere around here!</p>\n<p>Kris was a bit worried because the trail to Hannkampl was described as\ndifficult. But it was okay. The boys all did really well with the steep\nareas. The day was beautiful and we felt glad that we&#39;d come out.</p>\n<p>Nick was extra happy, it was his first time in these kind of mountains. He was a\ngreat hiker too! Rowan and Elijah were in heaven having a friend there, too.</p>\n<p>Coming down from the summit was a little tricky on scree slopes, but soon we\nwere eating delicious homemade Kaiserschmarrn at the Hochleger. Below this, Nick\nhad some trouble where he&#39;d sleep on the tricky trail and bang his knee: in the\nsame place twice! We used a pile of band-aids and bandages on the bloody wound!\nStill, he was a trooper.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403578808'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5566/14403578808_8edc7f64a6_b.jpg'></a>\nUp and up...</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14586880131'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3838/14586880131_e62bf0ff8c_b.jpg'></a>\nThe scary part</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14590180105'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3903/14590180105_f78f8f9c0d_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking to the giants...</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14403588158'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5572/14403588158_1daeb61891_b.jpg'></a>\nHigh point!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14586885301'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5157/14586885301_0b4f651b0e_b.jpg'></a>\nHiking down</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14589501742'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3844/14589501742_407a930069_b.jpg'></a>\nMore hiking</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14610279663'>\n<img src='https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2933/14610279663_5af7f01ddd_b.jpg'></a>\nA cow!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14586893041'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5570/14586893041_d8337d3224_b.jpg'></a>\nThe waterfall.</p>\n<p>We drove home, fully satisfied with the weekend.
