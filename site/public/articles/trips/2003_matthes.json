The Crest, at just about a mile long, \nconsists of over 5,000 feet of climbing on knife edge weathered granite. \nThe exposure is out of this world, and the climbing is just as fantastic.</p>\n<p>Michael and I woke up at 5:45 hoping to beat the so-called &quot;crowds&quot; you \nusually encounter on popular routes like this. We drove into the park \nand to the trailhead and immediately started hiking. We started up the \nCathedral Lakes trailhead and branched off on what we thought was the \nclimbers trail. We were wrong, but what&#39;s great about hiking in California \nis that there is minimal underbrush, unlike the dense forests of Washington, \nso we faired just fine. Eventually we made it up to the pass in-between some \nof the Echo Peaks and were greeted with grand views of the entire traverse. \nWe had to drop 800ft. down to the valley below the crest and follow it till \nwe got to the south end of the Crest. </p>\n<p>We made a sort of rising traverse \ntoward the start of the route from the valley floor and encountered some \nrock slabs that unnerved Michael a bit. He had old wore out hiker and \ndidn&#39;t give him good support while scrambling up the slabs. He paused \nand decided for the final bit of the slabs to put on his rock shoes. I \nmade it up to the bass of the route and started gearing up and uncoiling \nthe rope while I waited for Michael to finish the slabs. When he arrived \nat the start of the route he didn&#39;t look too happy. I asked him what was \nwrong, he replied &quot;I left my (expletive deleted) pole on the slabs while \nI was changing into my shoes and I forgot to pick it back up...it&#39;s gone man.\nIt&#39;s gone.&quot;, \nfollowed by more ensuing words of rage. I felt really bad and had to try \nand make him feel better. &quot;Michael, the first pitch is right here...it \nlooks sweet man...how about you take it! You&#39;ll cruise it man!&quot; It&#39;s \nmedicine that always works when climbing to give your partner a sweet \nlooking lead if he is feeling down and he is sure to perk up.  And it \ndid just that. Once Michael got tied in he instantly felt better. The \nfirst pitch was really fun, steep face climbing to a chimney gear belay \nhalf way to the crest. </p>\n<p>I took the rack and was ready to climb into the \nsun and up on to the crest. The second pitch continued with steep \nclimbing to a gear belay on the crest itself. I brought Michael up and we \nlooked ahead at what was to come. We decided to belay one more pitch \nalong the crest to get used to the climbing and then we would simul-climb \nfor as long as we could. So, Michael lead off on the third pitch which \nlooked steeper than it was and brought me up to his belay. From there I \ntook the rack and led off on our first simul-pitch. This section \nconsisted of easy but exposed climbing on the crest. I got to a steep point in \nthe ridge where it became about 3 feet wide and dropped off on both sides \nand since I was running low on gear I set a belay and brought Michael to \nmy stance. I re-racked and we dubbed the obstacle in front of us the \n&quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; It was my favorite feature of the climb. It \nwas fantastic climbing with a 600ft. drop off on my left and 800ft. on \nmy right. </p>\n<p>We continued simul-climbing to the South Summit where we \nfound the rap station to the notch in between South and North summits. \nThe rap station consisted of a sling around a horn of rock. Now \neverything I ever was taught said never trust a single sling so we \nbacked it up with a cam and Michael went down first being the heaviest. \nThe sling held his bounce test fine so when he called off belay I \ncleaned the cam and down I went. The next pitch from the notch up to \nthe north summit was the crux consisting of a 5.8 off-width hand crack \nthat I managed to grunt up. Once on the summit we smiled and laughed \nand enjoyed the views, but still knew we weren&#39;t done yet. </p>\n<p>The next \nsection of ridge was the most terrifying part of the climb. Michael \nled off as soon was out of view. The rope became taught so I started \nclimbing. Soon Michael came into view and he was straddling a flake \nbelaying me. It looked like hard downclimbing to get to him and it \nwas. Turned out to be 5.7/5.8 downclimbing with 700ft. of air \nunderneath me. &quot;Thank you Mike for the belay!&quot; I was freaked to \nsay the least and Michael&#39;s belay was really uncomfortable. </p>\n<p>We wanted to get moving. The next pitch \ndidn&#39;t offer any relief, huge airy flakes led to more scary downclimbing. \nAs Michael climbed down the short overhanging crack to my belay he \nthanked me for the pro and told me to take the lead again. To say \nthe least, the climb had a much more serious tone to it than expected. \nWe were committed to the ridge and had to keep moving. So I led off \nto gain more ground. Once the rope drag became to bad I set a belay \nand brought Michael to me. From there he set off and encountered more \nproblems with rope drag. After a bit more climbing along the ridge \nwe reached the pitch we called the &quot;Wave Pitch.&quot; We called it this \nbecause it consisted of a hand traverse on the lip of the ridge that \noverhung on the underside. The climbing was easy but there was no pro \nfor about 100 feet. From there I took over and started along the ridge, \nwe had had enough of scary downclimbing so I decided to take some \nthird class ledges underneath a tower to the finish slabs on the \nnorth side of the Crest. We rested and ate before the slog \nback. One final wave goodbye to the Crest at Echo pass \nand down we headed to the car.</p>\n<p>The Matthes Crest was everything I thought it would be and more. It tested \nour physical and mental strength and rewarded us with a beautiful climb and \njaw dropping views. An experience I will likely never forget!</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matcrest3.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matcrest3.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on the crest</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/tomatcrest.jpg\"><img src=\"images/tomatcrest.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>On the hike in</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/stairmaster.jpg\"><img src=\"images/stairmaster.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on the Stairway to Heaven</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/hangingout1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/hangingout1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>A solid, dependable ridge</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matcrest4.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matcrest4.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>More beautiful Crest</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/mattosum.jpg\"><img src=\"images/mattosum.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Climbing to the summit</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/meonmatcrest.jpg\"><img src=\"images/meonmatcrest.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Michael on the summit</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matsummit1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matsummit1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on the summit</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/backtosummit.jpg\"><img src=\"images/backtosummit.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Exciting down climbing</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/longway.jpg\"><img src=\"images/longway.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Endless ridge</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matcrest2.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matcrest2.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Can&#39;t get enuff...</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matintoto.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matintoto.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Tee hee!</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/rockcornice.jpg\"><img src=\"images/rockcornice.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>a gibbering Aidan points to the Wave Pitch</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/matcrest1.jpg\"><img src=\"images/matcrest1.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Last one, I promise</i>\n</td></tr></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/walktomat.jpg\"><img src=\"images/walktomat.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Goodbye, O Crest of Wonders</i></p>\n"}
