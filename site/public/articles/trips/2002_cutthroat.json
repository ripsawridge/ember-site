We reached the trail-head around 8 am, and were on the summit at\n12:30. We hung out up there for 2 hours, beginning our descent at 2:30\npm. Many rappels got us to the notch, and scrambling brought us to the\npretty basin in late afternoon. A great climb!</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/fromrd.jpg\" alt=\"Cutthroat Peak from the road\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/nicepitch.jpg\" alt=\"A nice pitch\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/flatarea.jpg\" alt=\"A great napping place\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/dasilver.jpg\" alt=\"A view to Silver Star Mountain\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/cutmedrink.jpg\" alt=\"Having a drink before the end\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/whistler.jpg\" alt=\"Whistler mountain, named for marmots?\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/viewsouth.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome view of Corteo, Goode, Storm King, Logan and Black\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/sumtblock.jpg\" alt=\"The summit block\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/finalbit.jpg\" alt=\"Short but nice fist crack\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/chrisrap.jpg\" alt=\"Chris on rappel\"></p>\n"}
