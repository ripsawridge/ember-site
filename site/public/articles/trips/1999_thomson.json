{"date":"1999-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Mount Thompson","description":"<p>With the good weather forecast, I was hoping for a weekend bursting with\nmountain climbs! Sadly, Steve was detained at work, so our planned climb of the\nWest Face of Sloan Peak had to be canceled (this climb <em>always</em> seems to get\ncanceled!). I searched for something I could do on my own, perhaps some\nscrambling and rappelling.  I settled on the Snoqualmie Pass area, with a nice\nwalk up to the Kendall Katwalk, and a climb of Mount Thomson. The Beckey\n&quot;Bible&quot; stated I could access Red Mountain from the area, and I hoped to climb\nHuckleberry Mountain too. I packed for overnight, needlessly bringing a bivy\nsack against non-existent wet weather.</p>\n<p>I had also purchased 50 meters of 6 mm static line, for a primitive rappel\nsetup.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/davidsum.jpg\" alt=\"David on the summit with the Three Queens behind\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/thomson.jpg\" alt=\"Early view of Thomson looming behind a ridge\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/goldcreek.jpg\" alt=\"The Gold Creek valley from Alaska mountain\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/huckleview.jpg\" alt=\"Huckleberry Peak from the PCT\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/kendallview.jpg\" alt=\"The backside of Kendall Peak from the PCT\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/methomsum.jpg\" alt=\"Me on the summit of Mount Thomson\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/queens.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome peaks visible from Thomson&#39;s summit\"></p>\n<p>Kris dropped me off at the PCT trailhead at 7:15 am, where I got some \ninformation\nabout the old trail to Red Mountain. It was easy to find, and after only\none mile of walking I reached a point that took 2.75 miles to reach had I\ntaken the long, switch-backing PCT. Happily, I moved along, rising and eventually\nworking around Kendall Peak on the PCT with great views of Mt. Rainier and\nlocal peaks such as Guye, Snoqualmie and Lundin. I really enjoyed the\nstretch of trail from the Kendall Katwalk to Ridge Lake. It looks down on a \ngreen valley, with bouldery meadows on either side of the trail. Great\nviews of Mount Thomson.</p>\n<p>I got water at Ridge Lake, easily found Bumblebee Pass, and was soon descending\ninto Thomson&#39;s protected basin. Edd&#39;s Lake seemed very mysterious and remote\nin a hanging valley below. Descending into the basin was difficult due to\nfresh snow and ice coating the boulders. Time consuming! But soon I was\nback in the sun and marmots eyed me warily from only 5 feet away.</p>\n<p>There were two obvious gullies leading up to the east ridge of the peak. The\nbook advises taking the left gully. Hmm. The left gully looks loose at the\nbottom and 5.hard for 20 feet before hitting the ridge. The right gully\nlooks cleaner, and features a steep heather slope and no rock climbing.\nBut it seems like you might get stopped by a cliff break in the ridge.\nAnyway, the book says to take the left gully. So reluctantly, I took it,\nclimbing rock, heather, and dirt slopes. Everything was loose, and I\naccidentally sent a few loud volleys of stone crashing down into the basin.\nOops!</p>\n<p>I moved out of the gully into a low-angled chimney cleaving the right wall\nwhere the rock was more solid. I could see a tree on the ridge 35 feet above.\nSwitching to rock shoes, I started up a side of the gully wall (the top of the\ngully was blocked by a huge, overhanging chockstone), and immediately\nrealized I wouldn&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t do this. The rock was vertical with occasional\nbulges to navigate around, and a fall would send me into the gully on\na brutal descent. I carefully climbed down, said &quot;forget it, I&#39;m looking\ninto the right gully whatever the book says!&quot; and began the tedious\nwork of down-climbing the entire gully.</p>\n<p>I was doing this, and noticed a climber in the basin looking up at me.\nAs I got closer, he waved and suggested a line on the left side of the\ngully. I traversed to it as he approached, and started up an exposed\n3rd/4th class ramp angling towards the west ridge. Somewhere in here we\nintroduced ourselves, and David went up to yet another line in the\ngully. I gave up on my ramp, as it wound out of sight with dramatic\nexposure. I was already a little frazzled!</p>\n<p>David was stumped at a 6 foot difficult move that appeared to lead\nto easier ground, and I didn&#39;t want to try it either. Finally, we both\nagreed to down-climb and take the right gully.</p>\n<p>This we did, and lo! This gully led to the ridge easily, and then a trail\non steep heather took us to a bracing viewpoint of the north side of the\nmountain, complete with snowy ledges and a 1000 foot vertical drop.\nPast this, we had more heather, then easy rock scrambling. The route\nwound around to the south, then ascended steeply on good rock with an\nunneeded handline. We reached a rappel station, then grandly walked\nthe final 20 feet to the summit. Yes!</p>\n<p>We took pictures and reveled in the view. It was good to have a partner\non the scary stuff below, and the additional energy two people can muster\nmay have helped us persevere in spite of those difficulties. Hey David,\nif you are out there, that was fun!</p>\n<p>We didn&#39;t break out the rope at the rap station, comfortable with the\ndown-climbing which was nothing like what we experienced in the gully.\nI lost points for cracking and grabbing the handline near the bottom of\nthe stemming crack! With each step down the steep heather I regretted not\nbringing hiking poles, as David had wisely done! Monday, my thighs still\nached...</p>\n<p>Once in the basin, my ambitious plan to climb Huckleberry Peak seemed\nridiculous. I was pretty beat, so I sat for a few minutes, eating and\ndrinking water from the trickling snowmelt. It was about 3 pm. I decided\nto go ahead on the PCT around and camp below Chikamin Peak, and climb\nit the following morning.</p>\n<p>Foolishly, I cached my rappel/climbing equipment at the top of Bumblebee\nPass. With lowering energy, I continued on the PCT, finally working my\nway around Alaska Mountain to a view of Huckleberry across the valley.\nI was low on water, and didn&#39;t see how to get any for miles without a\nlot of effort. Here, I also realized that the distance to Chickamin\nPeak was far greater than I thought! I had to meet Kris at Snoqualmie\nPass at 5:30 pm the next day, and wasn&#39;t too sure about walking 14\nmiles after climbing Chikamin and making it on time!</p>\n<p>So, with heavy heart I turned back. My choices for the next day were\nnow limited to Red Mountain or Lundin Peak. I picked up my cached\ngear (the climb up to the Pass was exhausting!), and tiredly built\na camp at Ridge Lake. I was sleeping by the time it was dark.</p>\n<p>In the morning I felt much better, and was walking back to the Kendall\nKatwalk by 7:15. I met a climber who started from the parking lot at\n2:30 by the lake. He headed for the east ridge. Later, I met a pair\ngoing to the west ridge. Shortly before the Katwalk, I left my gear\nand headed up steepening slabs and heather, coming to a grand view of\na snowy basin on the other side.  From what I could see, moving along\nthis ridge to Red Mountain was going to be tough. I climbed down then\nup again to a tri-corner ridge crest, then carefully followed the\nridge down towards Red Mountain. The exposure was incredible on the\nsnowy, shadowed side, where I edged around small gnarled trees. Eventually,\nand with some relief the left side angled back, permitting walking on\nsteep heather. Finally I had to step up to the ridge crest again, and\nhere learned that I wasn&#39;t going any farther. The ridge dropped off to\na low saddle, and there was no way I would try and descend that alone.</p>\n<p>Oh well, so for like the 3rd time this weekend I wimped out, working\nmy way back, and slowly down to the trail via heather and boulders.\nIt was only 10:30 am, but I realized I was probably done! There weren&#39;t any\nother grand mountains for me to climb, so I walked back, scrambling up\na subridge of Kendall Peak on the way. Later, I called Kris from the\ncell phone, so she could pick me up at 1:15. For the way down, I just\nconcentrated on the awesome view, stopping to rest often and prolong my\nvisit to the wilderness. I ran into a thru-hiker, almost finished with his\nlong journey from Mexico. Lots of people with dogs crowded the lower reaches\nof the trail, and the &quot;city-trail&quot; phenomenon occurred. This is when people\nstart looking straight ahead on the trail and not acknowledging you when\nthey pass! I make sure to give a hearty &quot;hello&quot; which just irritates them!\nI wonder, do they think it increases the &quot;wilderness experience&quot; to bring\ncity rules to the trails? The eye that perpetually seeks to avoid contact,\nhmm. I&#39;ve noticed that 2 of the 3 need to be satisfied for the effect\nto fade: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greater than 1 hour drive from town</li>\n<li>Greater than 3000 feet hiked up</li>\n<li>Greater than 4 miles in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So Kris picked me up, and we had a hilarious evening at the final Almost\nLive! taping, a great (now defunct) Seattle comedy program.</p>\n<p>Lesson: trust your instincts, not some book, even if it is the &quot;Bible!&quot;</p>\n"}
