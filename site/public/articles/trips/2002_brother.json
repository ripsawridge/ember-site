{"date":"2002-5-19","title":"South Brother South Couloir","description":"<p>Saturday night we went to see the comedian Steven Wright, and I really like\nhis old joke:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did you sleep good?</li>\n<li>No, I made a few mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Back from the show, I started planning a mountain climb for Sunday, but the\nforecast was kind of grim. I had noticed in satellite pictures that the cloud\nlayer was much thinner over the Olympics. The prevailing flow was from the\nSouth, channeled over the Cascades. The Olympics were clear! This got me\nexcited to visit the range after years of wistfully looking over there.</p>\n<p>I decided on the Brothers, and hastily threw my gear in the car, figuring\nthere was no time to sleep beforehand (I was &quot;Hooding it,&quot; named for\nthe common practice of climbing Mt. Hood Friday after work). For food I brought\nfried chicken and small cubes of cheese. I would later regret the lack of\ncarbohydrates in this fare. I paid slightly more attention to the map, but not\nenough. Around 3 am, I was lost on the Key Peninsula, and had to backtrack 10\nmiles. Finally I arrived at 4 am, and was soon hiking to Lena Lake on\ndepressingly flat switchbacks. I passed a few tents around the lake, and\nentered the Valley of Silent Men. I was too busy climbing fallen trees and\ncrossing bridges on the way in to notice it much, but enjoyed the trail on the\nway out. The huge mossy boulders and splintered trees have a primeval look. The\njunction with another creek, or &quot;base camp,&quot; is nothing special, just\na flat area in the forest with two feet of snow on the ground. It&#39;s very easy\nto lose the proper trail in here. I followed tracks in the snow that seemed to\nbelong to a party of 5, then 4, etc., finally one solitary stubborn man.\nFinally it was an all-out bushwhack with occasional bits of pink flagging. Then\nit started to rain. The stock of my enterprise was at a low, and I considered a\nreverse split. But then the terrain opened up into avalanche chutes, and I\ngratefully clambered aboard.</p>\n<p>Seven increasingly rugged miles to here, and I hadn&#39;t covered half the\nrequired elevation gain of 6200 feet. Now the climbing could begin, first up a\nlong 30 degree avalanche slope, scarred by thoughtless glissade paths. I really\nresented the thought of someone having fun hurtling down the gully and leaving\nthis environmental scar. My feeling of solitude, protected by law, was\ngrievously violated! It didn&#39;t occur to me to resent the helpful kicked steps,\nhmm...</p>\n<p>The gully widened and veered rightward. I saw a few people higher up. I also\nsaw a neat looking gully called the Hourglass. The route descriptions say to\navoid it, due to falling rock and snow. But with crunchy, stable snow, I just\nhad to climb that thing. Most tracks went down and around to the right, but\nsomeone had been up this before. It was fun to be in the narrow walled couloir.\nThere was a small moat to step over. Melt-out will make it harder to climb in\nthe coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Above this the gully widened greatly, with a large snow slope on the right.\nI went over to it, thinking to join the other folks who went to the right. The\nsnow was harder up here, so I put on crampons as it began to snow lightly. I\nwent back into the wide gully and climbed for another 1000 feet, going around a\nrocky buttress on the left. Happily, the cloud layer stayed above my peak the\nentire trip, so I had good local views. Since I was wet from the rain, a spot\nof warm sun would have been much appreciated. But when I examined the steaming\nchicken entrails I had brought for this purpose, they revealed that the sun\nwould never appear today. Never.</p>\n<p>An exciting steeper step (45 degrees?) on an exposed slope led me to a\n&quot;staging area&quot; 100 feet below the summit. There were 10-15 people\nhere in various stages of undress. No, but seriously folks, there was a crowd,\nwith about 7 people heading down and 8 going up. I put on a sweater due to the\ncold, strong wind, and followed some people up a steep snow chimney, then on a\ntrail pounded into loose talus (careful, the staging area is exposed to rock\nfall from this trail). I talked with some guys at the summit (10:15 am).\nEveryone was glad to be here and see the amazing view into the dark heart of\nthe Olympics. The range was vignetted by a gray shroud that cropped the highest\npeaks, but added to the mystery. Everyone left and I was alone: standing in the\nscreaming wind, munching hideously on a chicken breast. I contemplated the\ntraverse to the North Peak, which was very steep getting down from the South\nPeak. Better to go the other way, I think, and I would take a rope.</p>\n<p>With a mad cackle I retraced my steps, eventually passing the descending\nparties. I watched a few people attempt to glissade the very hard snow with\ncrampons on. I did mention something about the danger of this to them, but had\nto be tactful. I said &quot;Dang, I&#39;d like to glissade, but I&#39;d have to take\noff my crampons, and I want them for the Hourglass!&quot; I believe they quit\nthe attempt, but I didn&#39;t stick around to find out. I removed crampons and went\nfor some really fast rides below the Hourglass. Down to the brush, and a better\ntrail. Soon I was on the flats of &quot;base camp,&quot; but I got disoriented\namong the hundreds of tracks going every direction. After wasting 15 minutes, I\ngot out the compass and map. Due east led me to the river, then south along\nit&#39;s bank to the fork. Another guy heard me scrabbling around upstream and\ncalled out to check on me (thanks!). I took a rest at the fork while he\nand his partner packed up their camp, then I took off for Lena Lake. Once\nthere, I rested on an overlook of the lake, napping happily. That done, I\npounded down to the car, fuming at the low angle switchbacks. I was there at\n3:45, so it was an 11.5 hour day.</p>\n<p>At the car a forest ranger was waiting for me. He asked for my license and\nsocial security number. I gave him my license, but didn&#39;t see why I should give\nmy SS number (&quot;I&#39;ll get it anyway,&quot; he said). Since I didn&#39;t have a\nforest service pass, I got a ticket for a $30 dollar fine. I told him I didn&#39;t\nthink I should have to pay to hike on public land and that I believed that the\nproliferation of user fees for low-impact activities has to stop. He merely\nlooked pained, and sent me on my way.</p>\n<p>The drive home was the crux. I had to stop and sleep three times. A large\nman leaned out of an espresso stand and bellowed angrily at me. I didn&#39;t stick\naround to find out why. The day was cold and wet, but the mountain was good.\nThanks mountain!</p>\n"}
