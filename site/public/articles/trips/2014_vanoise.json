I give up! My joy won&#39;t be held hostage anymore\nby reports of precipitation. I drove to Aussois, purchased a small backpack and\nbought some snacks. I bought a map and read over my options. It looked like I\ncould do a loop hike from here up north to the Col de la Vanoise, and then back,\nclockwise. Right on, I thought.</p>\n<p>I stuffed my tiny backpack and headed up in a mix of clouds and sun, first going\nthrough a ski area, then to the lake of Plan d&#39;Amont. I hiked further,\neventually leaving a road to head straight up grass slopes to the top of the ski\narea. From here I hiked to the Refuge de la Dent Parach√©e, technically a bit out\nof my way but I had plenty of time. The country was beautiful. At the refuge I\nsat for a while and thought about ordering a drink. But the skies looked murky\nso I pressed on, going across a balcony then downhill. I left my umbrella at a\nrock and had to backtrack a few minutes to get it. But soon enough I was down at\nmy home for the night, the Refuge du Fond l&#39;Aussois. It was getting downright\ncold!</p>\n<p>I went in, ordered a glass of wine, read my book and just enjoyed the warm\ncommon room. After a short rest, I came back for dinner. Something great about\nthe French huts is that they usually serve wine with dinner, and it comes in the\nprice. I talked with some folks, including a nice fella from Germany, a teacher\nwho was doing almost the same hike but counter-clockwise. I went to sleep\npeacefully, knowing that the weather forecast wasn&#39;t great but that all I had to\ndo was walk. I didn&#39;t need dry rock slabs to make me happy.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15004758441'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3926/15004758441_397a0c8f39_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking back at the lakes.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821210380'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3920/14821210380_3dde3db6ac_b.jpg'></a>\nHome for the night.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007471832'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3880/15007471832_5981e37ebd_b.jpg'></a>\nAn old house.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14984875076'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5554/14984875076_6425402814_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Pointe de l&#39;Echelle</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821339787'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5586/14821339787_7b2a583ac8_b.jpg'></a>\nFrom the Pointe de l&#39;Observatoire</p>\n<p>In the morning I continued up valley making for the Col d&#39;Aussois. The weather\nwas surprisingly good. I was also packing a trail lunch I&#39;d purchased from the\nhut. At the col I detoured to hike up the Pointe de l&#39;Observatoire, a nice rocky\nscramble. I was in a hurry because the clouds were quickly lowering and the wind\nwas starting to scream. In the last minutes below the summit snowflakes started\nto fall. &quot;Hurry!&quot; I said, wanting to get a picture of the area and a view of the\nway ahead. I was just barely successful!</p>\n<p>Hiking down in light rain I entered a green valley and saw a few people, my\nfirst of the day. I was listening to &quot;the Art of Communicating&quot; by Thich Nhat\nHanh. It&#39;s a fascinating book. I like this simple Buddhist idea of thinking of\neffective communication as that communication which relieves suffering. Lost in\nmy own world, I rounded corners, went up and down and before I knew it the sun\nwas back out and I was near Chalet des Nants, an incredible meadow with a\nhanging glacier above, ice chunks draped over black cliffs looking ready to\ncrash down.</p>\n<p>I ate lunch on a rock here, really impressed with the &quot;French&quot; nature of the\npack lunch. There was bread, meat, cheese, a tin of corn and other\nvegetables. There were cookies, and a container of applesauce. Wow! This was a\nreal treat!</p>\n<p>I hiked uphill to the Refuge de la Vallette. In here, I was thinking about my\nboys and how their destiny might run in life. I saw them diverging and then\ncoming back together in a synergistic way. Somehow this kind of walking was\nproving to be medicine to me. I&#39;ve tried to convey it to friends, but it&#39;s so\nintensely personal, I guess.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007476292'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3916/15007476292_38b05230d6_b.jpg'></a>\nA last look to the lakes</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15004767081'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3868/15004767081_a4acd4717c_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Cimes des Planettes</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007479512'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3879/15007479512_a8b424036d_b.jpg'></a>\nAbove the Refuge du Roc de la Peche</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821246348'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5554/14821246348_f9f0eda450_b.jpg'></a>\nClearing weather</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007865915'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5574/15007865915_404d167c3a_b.jpg'></a>\nNear Chalet des Nants</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14984884246'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3842/14984884246_71b286b31d_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking across the valley</p>\n<p>It was only about 2:30, and I didn&#39;t want to go to the hut, knowing from\nexperience that once you go in and take off your shoes you don&#39;t come out again!</p>\n<p>I hiked up a broad flat-topped summit near the huts with excellent views up and\ndown valley. I could see the Valley de la Gliere, my destination for the next\nday. I was already realizing I could do more hiking per day than my &quot;reasonable&quot;\nitinerary showed. I made plans for a &quot;monster&quot; day, because the weather would be\ngood again and I didn&#39;t want to miss out.</p>\n<p>I descended to the hut as the rain and wind started. Within the hour, it would\nbegin to snow. The Refuge de la Valette was very cozy. Everyone gathered in the\ncommon room, and we put wet socks and garments as close to the wood stove as\npossible. I drank some coffee, then wine. Dinner was delicious. Stepping out\ninto the falling snow to get to the bunkhouse was bracing!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007486192'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5570/15007486192_146204ca9e_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Refuge de la Valette</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15004778311'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5567/15004778311_840a05f3d9_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Refuge de la Valette again</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14984892006'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3878/14984892006_c0f71dd688_b.jpg'></a>\nValley de la Gliere</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821258778'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3889/14821258778_f0697ae0c7_b.jpg'></a>\nMorning at the Refuge de la Valette.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821261488'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5592/14821261488_809f3f5fb5_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking north</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821361977'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5552/14821361977_7b19b167fd_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Col du Grand Marchet</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821363547'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5563/14821363547_fde56ec279_b.jpg'></a>\nCliffs of le Grand Marchet</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007502732'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3905/15007502732_49882c554a_b.jpg'></a>\nIbex at a waterfall</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821269628'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3920/14821269628_22cf1b9a62_b.jpg'></a>\nMore scenery to the north</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821173629'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3919/14821173629_664a94de2b_b.jpg'></a>\nTime for Second Breakfast</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821175209'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5563/14821175209_e0900d21d2_b.jpg'></a>\nA fine valley to ascend</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821275828'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3845/14821275828_c0344a011f_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Refuge du Col de la Vanoise</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821374707'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3918/14821374707_4b8601ce97_b.jpg'></a>\nA beautiful lake east of the col</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007514922'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5551/15007514922_e886217f5b_b.jpg'></a>\nA subpeak of the Grande Casse</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821255450'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5594/14821255450_40caf943e5_b.jpg'></a>\nScenery east of the Col Vanoise</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15004807301'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3915/15004807301_4a1412d74a_b.jpg'></a>\nTrail monument</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821187939'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3886/14821187939_e7765181b1_b.jpg'></a>\nOne of many beautiful valleys I traversed</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821287748'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3835/14821287748_f322b040de_b.jpg'></a>\nChamois posing</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821387097'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3852/14821387097_a1318b6f8f_b.jpg'></a>\nThe valley of Termignon</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821191809'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5577/14821191809_5a605480fe_b.jpg'></a>\nTrail marker.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821291518'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5573/14821291518_a373727dc0_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Refuge de l&#39;Arpont</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14984929126'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3858/14984929126_41043cb088_b.jpg'></a>\nWith disturbing self-reflexivity</p>\n<p>In the morning, the ground was white with snow and frost. But no matter, the sun\nwas already out. I traversed mountainsides to get a view of the town Pralognan\nla Vanoise below, with morning clouds being scraped away by the sun. I passed\nthrough the Col du Grand Marchet then crossed a waterfall on treacherous frozen\nrocks while Ibex stared at me impassively.</p>\n<p>Eventually I stopped for a snack in the Valley de la Gliere, to dry my feet and\nsocks on warm rock. After 3.5 hours of hiking, I was at the Refuge du Col de la\nVanoise, and it would have been crazy to stop here for the night. I would fit in\nanother &quot;day&quot; today.</p>\n<p>I passed a beautiful lake and was in awe of exciting new views to the North and\nEast now that the bulk of glaciers had been bypassed. Here the scenery was\nreally amazing, probably my favorite. I traversed a series of broad valleys with\ngranite peaks and amazing blue lakes. I saw more Ibex and Chamois were\neverywhere. I loved this constant walking! Finally, in early evening I reached\nthe Refuge de l&#39;Arpont. It was a sleek, modern building, only the bunkhouse\nretained the traditional look. Happily, I met my German friend again here. We\nhad a great long conversation about the world, politics, the environment.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15007915735'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5551/15007915735_f9098d8c57_b.jpg'></a>\nAbandoned farms</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821299918'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5569/14821299918_565b850473_b.jpg'></a>\nBeautiful day above Termignon</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821399847'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3864/14821399847_f5de904de9_b.jpg'></a>\nWonderful country</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821204959'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5554/14821204959_c254153f82_b.jpg'></a>\nI loved this balcony walk</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821206479'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5555/14821206479_da26d7edc3_b.jpg'></a>\nLooking south</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14821281350'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3914/14821281350_80bba441d4_b.jpg'></a>\nBack home to Aussois</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14984942676'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3847/14984942676_4a33b69e11_b.jpg'></a>\nA packed lunch</p>\n<p>In the morning I set off to the south, again with a packed lunch from the\nhut. Beautiful balcony trails followed, with only occasional ups and\ndowns. There were quite a few old collapsed farms in this section. I talked with\na French woman on the trail who I&#39;d seen yesterday as well. She had a very heavy\npack but was small and tough. I thought about her for quite a while\nafter. Solitude has a way of spreading out small interactions, so that each word\nand turn in the conversation is later examined and drawn out in the mind. I\nimagine on the great lonely frontiers of 19th century America a settler would\nlearn so much from the interaction of just a few words with another. Once you\nare used to that style, it seems clear that the information overload of a city\nwould be experienced as horror.</p>\n<p>Paragliders, that signifier of good weather, were everywhere. It did remain\nquite cold though, despite the yellow sun. But these days of good weather made\nme feel good about trying to climb again. I enjoyed my lunch by an abandoned\nfarm, again impressed with the whimsical variety of the contents (the\ncheese was <em>especially</em> good), then finished\nthe hike down to Aussois, at one point helping a lady who was descending a ski\nslope on her butt. She had weak knees and this was the safest way. I offered an\narm and we went together this way - hopefully I wasn&#39;t annoying!</p>\n<p>Back in town I had an amazing tagliatelle lunch with beer at an outdoor table by\na fountain. I was really in the lap of luxury, no matter how much hiking I\ncrammed into a day!</p>\n<p>I drove down valley to an anonymous camping site, contacted Georg for a plan to\nmeet up the next day, enjoyed a pizza dinner and slept outside by the car.</p>\n<p>Georg and I would drive a lot and try mightily to climb, but the weather just\nwouldn&#39;t allow it. The hiking life was the better one, at least this year.</p>\n"}
