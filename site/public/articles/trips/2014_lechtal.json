I’d read about a 5 day\nhike that encircled a collection of these mountains, and had the wild idea to\nmake the hike over the weekend. With these two strapping fellas, I’m sure we\ncould do it!  Anyway, we munched on some bread for dinner and got to the town in\na light rain. Trying to find a place to sleep, we ran into an old man in the\ncemetery gathering mushrooms. He was very friendly, and suggested we roll on\ndown to the museum on the edge of town. Below a parking lot was a “pioneer home”\nmuseum. We got our sleeping bags out and did some rustication of the exhibits in\norder to make room for a dry place to sleep under the awnings. I think Uli\nshared some schnapps and we drifted into a comfortable sleep lulled by the sound\nof the river.</p>\n<p>In the morning, we re-assembled the pioneer home, munched on some cookies and we\nwalking in light rain. We crossed the river on the northeast side of town, then\nturned steeply right up the Platzbach. Soon we warmed up, even as the clouds\nlifted. Florian and I joked about selling ever-more exclusive outings to people\nwith too much money. Specialness comes with scarcity, so the more you pay the\nless you are provided with. A catered lunch? How about a pinecone instead -\nwhose story will be more interesting years later? So the outing with a hastily\ntossed pinecone dinner costs 3000 dollars, while the catered dinner is 300\ndollars. Wonderful!</p>\n<p>We followed watercourses to the Kogelsee, and thence to the Kogelseescharte\n(2497 m). We’d climbed about 1200 meters, and now were firmly in the high\ncountry. We descended past the Parzinn Lakes to the Parzinn Alp, nodding a quick\nhello over to the Hanauer Hütte, the “prime noctre” destination for those on the\n5 day plan. Pah! we said.</p>\n<p>We had to remove shoes to cross a small river, which was fun. Climbing up to the\nWestliche Dremelscharte, we wondered if we should climb the Dremelspitze. It was\nstill cloudy, but occasional breaks made us hopeful for some good views. At the\npass, a party was snacking. We said hello and started up the marked scrambling\nroute. What an amazing scramble! It was quick steep and enjoyable. You are\nalways going around corners, up chimneys, over gables and along narrow\nridges. It had a little bit of everything. Rated III for one move right at the\nstart, it was continuous grade II terrain. In the USA I’d call this an excellent\n4th class scramble.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350020438'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3936/15350020438_221e3aaaec_b.jpg'></a>\nClimbing</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15533490821'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3937/15533490821_659250c19c_b.jpg'></a>\nClimbing II</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14915442994'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5612/14915442994_0f299284a6_b.jpg'></a>\nClimbing III</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15533494471'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3929/15533494471_d3e526887b_b.jpg'></a>\nThis ridge is a climb</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15512494536'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3936/15512494536_b0fbbef9b0_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Steinseehuette</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15349562859'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3939/15349562859_6ba59f49ce_b.jpg'></a>\nOh.

We waited for a while in\nhope, then descended quickly. On the other side of the pass we came to a place\nUli had been to before…a wonderland of multi pitch rock climbing at the Steinsee\nand the Steinseehuette. We’ll be back here with a rope, for sure. We got some\nwell-deserved lunch at the Steinseehuette: Kaiserschmarrn of course! We climbed\nsomewhat tiredly up to the Grasgufeljoch (2382 m), skirting it then continuing\nto the Rosskarscharte. Descent from this place was hilarious, with long metal\ncables meant for hand-over-hand lowering down steep slopes of scree and\nrubble. As evening came on, we climbed over the Gebäudjoch, then down to our\nhome for the night. The Württemberger Haus wasn’t expecting us but they had\nroom. We were in an amazing cirq of stone mountains and meadows, with a rather\nremote feeling that nicely matched the feeling of long-distance travel.</p>\n<p>We washed our feet in the cold stream, then we had some beers, joked around a\nbit then went to bed. Florian was already thinking of a plan that I hadn’t even\nconsidered. Our booklet promoted a possible side climb of the Parseierspitze,\nwhich is the only 3000 meter peak (actually 3036 m) on the north side of the\nRiver Inn. The peak was well out of the way of our loop. But gosh, Florian was\nenthusiastic! Uli and I exchanged looks…knowing how tough this would be! We’d\njust climbed 2500 meters up, 1600 down across 15 kilometers over 8 hours. We\nwere tired for sure, and with the Parseierspitze we were committing to another\nreally big day.</p>\n<p>No problem!</p>\n<p>In the morning we had a light breakfast and set out for the Seescharte, climbing\npast the Großbergspitze (2657 m), then a spectacular long ridge to the\nGroßbergjoch. In here I got ahead of Florian and Uli, listening to music and\njust having a blast. Did I mention the weather? It was perfect blue sky!! To the\nright we had the valley of the Oberlahmsberg and on the left the Lochbach, a\nlonely looking place. I said hello to some Gämse along the trail, then made my\nway up to the Seescharte where a crowd of people were sitting. We’d hardly seen\nanyone on the trail over the whole trip, but here was a crowd. On the other side\nof the pass there was a whole new vista with the beautiful Seewisee lakes, and I\ncould barely see the Oberlahmsjoch which we’d be getting to many hours from now.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15533506041'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5609/15533506041_33baab9b60_b.jpg'></a>\nIMG_20140906_190258.jpg</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350568330'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3946/15350568330_942568d73a_b.jpg'></a>\nOMG it&#39;s actually summer</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15537036592'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5605/15537036592_247a1fb245_b.jpg'></a>\nWe are consumers</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14916026533'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5606/14916026533_2769b74f60_b.jpg'></a>\nFlo and our distant summit</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350042668'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5604/15350042668_e9bf166afd_b.jpg'></a>\nWild valleys</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350044958'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3927/15350044958_1020e12a36_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Seescharte</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15537041612'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5600/15537041612_ccbf2d5615_b.jpg'></a>\nSlightly fantastical shapes</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350198067'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5603/15350198067_187b524063_b.jpg'></a>\nThe 3000er!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14916034133'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5598/14916034133_f1e1628d13_b.jpg'></a>\nUli confronts the 3000er</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350052128'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3932/15350052128_18b9dbb7f3_b.jpg'></a>\nOn the face</p>\n<p>From the sparse map, we’d hoped we could traverse from the Seescharte over to\nthe Wegscharte, the pass that marked our southward journey to the great\nParseierspitze. But unfortunately, the ridge was pretty spiky and I feared it\nwould be very time consuming so I descended 100 meters to scree slopes and\nfollowed a faint trail to the Wegscharte. Uli and Florian arrived at the pass\nand we hollered back and forth. They thought I’d gone a wrong way. No way, good\nsirs! I’d never walk one step too many!</p>\n<p>I hung around a while at the Wegscharte looking at the Parseierspitze. It was an\nimpressive mountain. The fellas arrived and we descended an ingenious trail\nprotected by iron through cliffs to a long traverse of the upper Loch valley. At\nthe Parseierjoch we were somewhat dismayed. We’d expected the trail to go\nscrambling up to the clean north ridge of the Parseierspitze which looked\nfantastic from here. But instead it descended via a series of vertical ladders\ninto a snowy, muddy circ, then climbs up an alarmingly loose slope of sintered\nblack rock and occasional snow for 300 meters to the Patrolscharte.</p>\n<p>Boy, we were a little tired at this point! And knowing how much ground we had to\ncover back to the car so, so far away! But we started straight up the ridge\ntowards the impressive summit. I saw a large marker on the left side of the\nridge, and a couple of hikers scrambling near it. “Hey guys, I think we should\ngo down here!” I called, but Uli had already espied a way directly up.</p>\n<p>I caught up Flo and Uli in a series of tricky chimney moves. I had some\nmisgivings about the route, thinking that even if the scrambling was enjoyable,\nit was risky in terms of available time. And plus, gee, it was getting dicey\ntoo. Uli disappeared around a corner, as the way never opened up to allow us to\nreally take off and he had to keep searching. I decided I wanted to return and\ngo the standard route, and the guys came with me. It’s unfortunate to turn\naround when you have your “nose” on something, but gosh, the clock was ticking!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15533521191'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3944/15533521191_ca018deeae_b.jpg'></a>\nLaughing about the Communist Kangaroo</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15537049572'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5602/15537049572_14e4ba9602_b.jpg'></a>\nA Sunday afternoon in September</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15536229395'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3942/15536229395_3dd437a7bb_b.jpg'></a>\nMore peaks</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350588120'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3932/15350588120_6c8e76d631_b.jpg'></a>\nForeign Lands</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14915479104'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3953/14915479104_f30b8722d5_b.jpg'></a>\nUli on top</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15512528766'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3946/15512528766_ec983fef2f_b.jpg'></a>\nFlo and warm sun</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15536236435'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3955/15536236435_9f510b5a19_b.jpg'></a>\nWe feel like this</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14916051483'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3943/14916051483_38e8446bc5_b.jpg'></a>\nAfter a visit with the Gods</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15349600989'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3942/15349600989_1301dc0a16_b.jpg'></a>\nMountain Lake</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350597910'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3936/15350597910_d064940c26_b.jpg'></a>\nNear the Memmingerhuette</p>\n<p>We descended and made our way up the standard way, which was no pushover,\nespecially at the start. We had to hand-over-hand up a slippery metal cable and\nicy rocks for 20 meters before we could walk again. Then we had a never-ending\njourney up cracks, corners, chimneys and faces. Now that we knew we would\nsucceed, we enjoyed ourselves again.</p>\n<p>On top the view was incredible. I love the look of these western Kalkalpen with\nthe green valleys! We hung around a bit, amazed at how much we’d climbed so far\nand how much we still had to do. The journey back to the Wegscharte seemed to\ntake forever, and I was one tired puppy at the pass.</p>\n<p>We got a lift by finding a container of “Hugo” perfume sitting at the pass. We\napplied it liberally, hoping that some nice ladies would dine with us for our\noutdoor lunch at the Memminger Hütte. That fueled my march there, and again I\nwent ahead listening to 65daysofstatic (my new favorite band). I really felt\nenergized now! I was just whistling and dancing like a fool down the rocky\ntrail.</p>\n<p>At the hut, I grabbed a table. It was now 4:30, and I was glad they would still\nserve us a “lunch.” Some nice ladies came and sat by us...the Hugo is working!\nThey were on a two week trek heading south to Merano. The view from the hut was\nbeautiful, looking west to excellent peaks like the Freispitze. We took off our\nshoes and tried to rest up before the last leg after dinner.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15533539561'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3949/15533539561_a2c6b4f577_b.jpg'></a>\nView from the hut</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15537068142'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5604/15537068142_9ca49e66b1_b.jpg'></a>\nTo the Oberlahmsjoch</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350076448'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3927/15350076448_dba1ed9c35_b.jpg'></a>\nThe Memmingerhuette</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15349610899'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3933/15349610899_cbdb2d5e7b_b.jpg'></a>\nA toy valley</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15536251215'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3952/15536251215_2e7afe76da_b.jpg'></a>\nA friend at the Joch</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350612920'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3945/15350612920_88b22258be_b.jpg'></a>\nJunction</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15537082632'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3947/15537082632_8a076b9f02_b.jpg'></a>\nWeird sunset light</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15350240797'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3938/15350240797_6c511cc1bf_b.jpg'></a>\nA peevish friend</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/15536264565'>\n<img src='https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5601/15536264565_6c06166c84_b.jpg'></a>\nTropical evening</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/14916080873'>\n<img src='https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3938/14916080873_090116250a_b.jpg'></a>\nA rather high address</p>\n<p>In early evening, we climbed slowly up to the Oberlahmsjoch (2505 m), for the\nfirst time bypassing an opportunity to climb a peak, the Oberlahmsspitze at only\n2658 meters but a decent ways to the north from the pass. Flo was fascinated by\nSteinbock at the pass, urging me to take a dozen silhouette pictures. The light\nwas fading, and it was tough to get a good one. We rambled down scree slopes\ninto a great silent valley, the walls turning pink. Now we climbed to the\nStreichgampenjoch, passing an idyllic farmstead where we rested a few minutes.</p>\n<p>On to the Alblittjoch, a great cow and sheep migration path. As the light failed\nwe fell down an ever steeper path that became highly uncomfortable as the hours\nwent by. Uli and I suffered the most without hiking poles, feeling in the dark\nfor holes on the steep path under great leaves and ferns. Slippery logs and\nmossy boulders were our companions in suffering.</p>\n<p>After what felt like years, we hit the valley floor. I worried that we’d have\ntrouble finding the trail and was so happy to find a cairn marking the river\ncrossing in the darkness. Once we were on the other side of the river, we were\nhome free, and caroused along in the moonlight, strangely light-footed.</p>\n<p>The trail widened, eventually became a road. The town materialized out of the\ndarkness. We walked by the mushroom-filled cemetery, found the car and drove\naway at 11 pm. We’d been on the move almost 14 hours, climbing 2300 meters and\ndescending 3200 over 27 kilometers. For the weekend, we’d gone up and down 4800\nmeters.
