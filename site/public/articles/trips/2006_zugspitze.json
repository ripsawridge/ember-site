I brought hiking boots, aluminum crampons\nand an ice axe. In retrospect, it was a bit cold for light hiking boots! My\ncamera was broken, but I expected to be in clouds all day anyway, so I didn&#39;t\nmind leaving it (wish I had it in retrospect!).</p>\n<p>Starting the walk from Hammersbach in the dark, I followed a few wrong trails,\nbut finally got on the right track. As I hiked and listened to music it became\nlight, and I reached the little building and mysterious set of doors into the\nmountain at the entrance to the Hoellental gorge. Though it was &quot;closed,&quot; I\ncould step over the chain and go in. I knew that the authorities dismantle some\nof the bridges and walkways in the winter, but I hoped to be able to get by\nanyway. It was possible, but kind of interesting, as various &quot;pieces&quot; of the\ntrail were missing. It&#39;s not too hard to get by.</p>\n<p>Above the Hoellentalangerhuette there was full snow, though at first tracks kept\nme moving pretty fast. I approached a massive cliff and wondered how to get\nthrough. But soon I was on the rock, carefully ascending ladders and crossing\nthe famous &quot;Brett,&quot; where steel pegs allow you to walk across a blank and icy\ncliff face. The hut below looked increasingly like a toy.</p>\n<p>Now atop the cliff, I entered a long zone of snowy terrain beneath the glacier,\nsometimes climbing short cliffs or hunting for tracks in the snow. I encountered\na strong, chilling wind and for the first time saw beautiful plumes of blowing\nsnow whirling around on the cliffs above. Anticipating exposure to stronger\ngusts, I hid in some bushes and altered my clothing. I put on a balaclava,\nglacier goggles, thick gloves, and a wind jacket over my sweater. Now as long as\nI could see, I could keep hiking. I put away the iPod, having truly left &quot;casual\nground&quot; by this point!</p>\n<p>Long, tedious hours of trail-breaking followed, which seemed to take me\nnowhere. Sometimes there was a crust, and just when I thought I could walk on\ntop, it would collapse and leave me in a deep hole. I often went too fast, and\nhad to look around at the walls, breathing hard. Very slowly, I approached the\nglacier, resolving to go between the two distinctive crevasse fields on the left\nand right. I was very happy to see I didn&#39;t have to climb to the top of the\nglacier, as the fixed rope was only a short way above the crevasses on the\nright. As I approached, the glacier steepened, and my trusty ice axe protected\nthe climb to a metal ladder on the rock. I had to be careful to avoid falling\ninto the moat between ice and rock, though lots of recent snow made this fairly\neasy.</p>\n<p>Once I climbed the ladder, I saw the cable traversing right, then disappearing\nin snow. It was a nervous session, kicking steps and searching for good axe\nplacements above the cliff. Unfortunately, the snow was not very deep, so I was\ndoubly disadvantaged: I couldn&#39;t find the cable to hold on to under the snow,\nand I had to make do with shallow axe placements that would have a hard time\nholding me if my boot steps collapsed. At the same time, this was terrain where\na fall is not allowed!</p>\n<p>So I spent plenty of time verifying the security of each step, and my progress\ncontinued at the crawling pace I&#39;d established on the snowy glacier. No matter:\nthe sky was blue and I&#39;d long ago gotten used to the gusts of wind and snow\nflurries.</p>\n<p>However I nearly turned around when I couldn&#39;t judge if the route continued\ntraversing steep snow to the right or somehow went up cliffs. Continuing to the\nright looked very implausable, as my ramp faded away into the face. I wondered\nfor a good while, then finally saw a portion of cable on rock above and\nright. Kicking steps up to it, I first made an over-eager attempt to climb snowy\nrock straight to the cable. Bad idea! I&#39;d removed a glove for better grip on a\nsmall hold, only to realize there was nothing positive above for the final\nmove. Fingers freezing, I climbed down and carefully dealt with the steep,\nbreakable snow, grabbing the exposed cable with some relief. This turned out to\nbe the mental and physical crux of the day, as cold extremities and uncertainty\nmade me think of retreating. But now I could follow the cable on rock, with feet\nout of the snow and toes gradually unfreezing.</p>\n<p>The cliffs at this point become ever more imposing, and my footsteps on the\nglacier below smaller and more toylike. What a strange place to be in the\nwinter! I could see the summit cross for many hours, but it never got\ncloser. Putting my mind firmly on my work, I kicked steps and secured myself\nwith the ax over and over. When the cable was exposed, I could hold it and\ntravel more quickly. After a long upward stretch, I could see the rest of the\nroute to the summit block. It was probably a quarter-mile of traversing the\ncliffside, occasionally protected by cable. I continued slowly but securely,\nsometimes noticing people at the building on the summit looking at me. I must\nhave been a tiny speck with a red helmet in a vast sea of snow and rock! I got a\nkick out of thinking that they might be amazed. But they were probably angrily\ndebating taxpayer rescue costs should I get hurt!</p>\n<p>Finally, rather tired after 7000 feet of climbing, I approached the summit. I\nwas particularly stunned by the view down the long jagged ridge to the\nZwoelferkopf. I believe Mat once climbed up by following that long ridge, which\nis really amazing. On the windy, cold summit I was amazed to see a teeming ski\narea on the other side, and a whole complex of buildings and lifts. I climbed\ndown from the summit block, then up onto the large promenade platform of the\nbuilding. It contained two restaurants, a hotel (the Muenchnerhaus), 3 gondolas,\na museum, a gift shop and various other amenities. I admired the huge views and\njagged peaks in every direction but north, where I saw the Bavarian lakes.</p>\n<p>I gave up on hiking down, as it would be dark within 2 hours. A fellow climber\nnamed Daniel had come up the Reintal valley, and we became partners on the\ndescent, buying the right tickets, then going down to the flats to wait for the\ntrain through the mountain. Long lines and crowds of skiers were wearying, but\nfinally I was dropped off in Hammersbach and allowed to walk back to my car as\nthe first fireworks of the New Year were set off.</p>\n<p>A great trip, with good timing in retrospect. Folks have reminded me how\ndangerous the valley is when there is more snow, and large portions of the route\nare exposed to avalanche danger. Probably best to do it in early winter or wait\nuntil early summer. Happy New Year!</p>\n"}
