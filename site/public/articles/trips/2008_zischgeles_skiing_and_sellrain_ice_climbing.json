{"date":"2008-1-10","title":"Zischgeles skiing and Sellrain ice climbing","description":"<p>Right when I got back from Hawaii, I slept a while then set out at 3 am,\npointing the car towards the Stubai Mountains. I met Cyrille and Christian\nthere. Cyrille had a nasty knee injury, got while skiing into a rock the\nday before. So Christian and I skied up the popular peak Zischgeles, not\nfar from LÃ¼sens. We were in the fog a lot, but the skin up was good exercise.\nThe last two hundred meters of scrambling to the summit made for interesting\nclimbing in clumsy ski boots. We got some interesting misty views, then\nstarted down. My skiing was bad as usual, but we eventually made it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105746720074658\"><img src=\"http://lh4.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xnYom5K6I/AAAAAAAABdo/Uf63Ltuy5DY/s288/summitzisch.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105759604976562\"><img src=\"http://lh3.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xnZYm5K7I/AAAAAAAABdw/d96JMZrsEKo/s288/summitv.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I was tired so I took a nap. We went for dinner, and the next day Cyrille\nfelt well enough to do some ice climbing. We climbed Gasthausfall on top\nrope many times. Well, I led half of it, then got scared. Cyrille finished\nit and then it was a fun afternoon of top roping. Really neat to try out\nCyrille&#39;s leashless tools. It seems like a great way to go. My down jacket\nand MEC thermos full of tea made the cold bearable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105776784845762\"><img src=\"http://lh3.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xnaYm5K8I/AAAAAAAABd4/Zi5X8rFocrk/s288/gasthausfall.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105793964714962\"><img src=\"http://lh3.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xnbYm5K9I/AAAAAAAABeA/1nXAQU0CJLY/s288/lookingdowng.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105806849616866\"><img src=\"http://lh6.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xncIm5K-I/AAAAAAAABeI/I81h3gYB68U/s288/christianclimb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>That night we ate at a restaurant, and rather lamely went to bed at a\ndecent hour (uh, it was New Years Eve, or Silvester in the German world).\nChristian did the right thing and got up at midnight to watch fireworks\nin the village.</p>\n<p>The next day was extremely cold. Just walking in to the ice climbing area\nwas painful. I led a pitch, and foolishly set a belay at an uncomfortable\nhanging stance. If I had known how uncomfortable Christian and I would\nbe hanging out there while Cyrille continued leading above, I would have\ndone something different! It was a real test of will to survive without\ncrying. Toes, muscles, fingers, everything hurt. My climbing harness hurt.\nEverything freezing cold too. If I leaned against the ice too long my jacket\nwould freeze to it. Finally Cyrille belayed us each on a line.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105845504322562\"><img src=\"http://lh3.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xneYm5LAI/AAAAAAAABeY/r6w6crx3pZY/s288/icecliffs.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/SellrainClimbing2008/photo#5151105871274126354\"><img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/ripsawridge/R3xnf4m5LBI/AAAAAAAABeg/0Mg7oC0DTeg/s288/easyafternoon.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We were shivering like crazy! It was good to be moving though. I went\nto the side of Christian to avoid any chunks of ice. Suddenly Christian\nfell, and there was enough rope stretch that it was at least 10 feet. He\nwas fine, but it made us a little nervous. He tried once more, but had\nexhausted himself the first time. So I hurried another 50 meters to Cyrille&#39;s\nbelay while Christian waited.</p>\n<p>At the belay Cyrille and I rigged a rappel where we could pass the knot\nand thus lower Christian 100 meters to the ground. I know he was relieved\nto be off the troublesome icefall! Other than that complication, it was\na fun pitch. Cyrille and I made two double rope rappels to the ground,\nthe second one was freehanging, next to the frozen ice. Very beautiful.</p>\n<p>We called it a day and went home after a late lunch. The mountains were\nbeautiful on the drive home.</p>\n"}
