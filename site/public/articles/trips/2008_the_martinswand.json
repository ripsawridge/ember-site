With recent snowfall, we needed to\nstay at lower elevations, preferably south facing. I chose the Martinswand.\nI&#39;d been there once before to climb a via ferrata which was kind of &quot;blech.&quot;\nSorry, but it&#39;s just not a mountain experience when you are endlessly pulling\nyourself up metal cables, not touching rock at all!</p>\n<p>First we did a 5 pitch route called <a href=\"http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=283\">&quot;Flying Grass.&quot;</a> Rated\nVII- (5.10b/c), it&#39;s completely bolted. There were some interesting moves,\nthough the VII- crux was too hard for us! We could pull past it, and enjoy\nseveral VI/VI+ pitches in better style.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2962720003/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3244/2962720003_62d6091011.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2962720391/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2962720391_342b67c3bf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Above this route, we scrambled a ways to the west to reach the start of\nthe <a href=\"http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=285\">Ostriss</a>,\nrated VI (5.9). This is a 4-5 pitch vertical crack climb. The first pitch\nwas a little scruffy, but had a nice character all the same. The second\npitch had the first real crack climbing. This being limestone, there were\nonly a few good jams, but I loved the steepness. At the top of this pitch\nwas an airy semi-hanging belay. Dan took off for another steep pitch while\nI admired the Inn River far below, and the noisy autobahn. Across the valley\nthe snow on the Stubai Alps was melting visibly. I combined the last two\npitches, which had a slab, then another steep corner pitch.</p>\n<p>We hiked down to the car, then moved west to climb the <a href=\"http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=289\">Auckenthaler Riss (Auckenthaler Crack)</a>,\nrated VII-. It took quite a while to find the start of this route, and\nunfortunately we ran out of time to finish it. We climbed 4 interesting\npitches. The last one, at grade VI-, gave a foretaste of the consistently\nhard pitches that would follow. Alas, we&#39;d have to wait for another day.\nWith our single 50 meter rope we had to be adventurous in our rappels to\nthe base. A long downclimb back to the car ensued.</p>\n<p>All of these routes are either completely bolted, or just need a small\nselection of small/medium cams to protect. The Auckenthaler Riss is 9 pitches,\nclimbing almost the entire wall. Not bad for a &quot;climbing garden&quot; right\nbeside the road!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2962721345/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/2962721345_cb0a924c42.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2963565758/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/2963565758_73d1a71051.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"}
