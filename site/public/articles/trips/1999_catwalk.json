My cherished black climbing\npants were in tatters. I felt like a faux-&quot;delirious desert traveler,&quot; as\nthe tears in the fabric were too artistically jagged to be real. Inspired\nby Mattias, the &quot;frugal German,&quot; I had lovingly repaired rips with needle\nand thread before, but this time it was beyond my kin. With characteristic\nkindness, Steve&#39;s laughter was no louder nor longer than my own!</p>\n<p>Okay, so here we are, Steve and I, trying to zoom up rugged Oak Creek for our\nfirst adventure climb of the trip: Catwalk. This climb is in the very back of\nthe canyon, and despite a pre-dawn start, we now stood puzzled in burning heat,\ntrying to guess the route ahead. We&#39;d allocated two hours for the approach, and\nwe&#39;d now burned three. Even still, we&#39;d been hopping the small rocks and\nclimbing the big ones as fast as we could.  Steve&#39;s daylight-o-meter went off,\nand we both soon calculated that we didn&#39;t have enough time to finish without\nrisking a night out.</p>\n<p><em>Darn!</em></p>\n<p>It was 9 am, the crickets were chirping, the sky was blue, and we were\ntalking about retreating. In scouting the route, I had gone ahead on\nfourth class terrain (ie, the climbing is very easy, but a fall could\nbe fatal) and thought I spied the base of the route another 40 feet \ndistant. After a scary downclimb of that same terrain, I was feeling\nlike this &quot;initial investment,&quot; and our hard work &quot;zooming&quot; up the\ncanyon (yeah, right, I can hear Jeff say), we should try the route.\nWe both felt strong, and noticed the words &quot;escape possible&quot; after\npitch five on the route. Yes! From our vantage point, it looked like\nthis would provide an easy ridge walk, and then a stroll down the\nback side of the mountain. Not inclined to gamble with our lives,\nSteve&#39;s eyes lit up as the daylight-o-meter admitted that we&#39;d have\njust enough time, by cutting off the last three pitches. Go!</p>\n<p>!A good portrait of Steve at the start of pitch four.](images/steveport.jpg)</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/meport.jpg\" alt=\"I look kind of ready for a nap, don&#39;t I?\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/p6cwalk.jpg\" alt=\"This was the hardest pitch. Where the route goes behind\nthe boulder above, the climb becomes very thin for fingers and \nalmost non-existent for feet! There was a fixed #2 \nCamelot when we were there in the only good spot for pro.\"></p>\n<p>Leaving a pack 200 feet above the stream-bed, we traversed on my\npioneered route, then another rope length, and we had come\neven with the base of pitch two on the topo map. We saw a crack\nleaning left and up, crossed by numerous black water marks. Steve\ntook the first lead, frictioning out on bald faces, and up to a\nbulge which marked the belay. Building the anchor took some creativity,\nand he had just the bits of metal to lodge into just the right\nconstrictions to build a good one. Pant tatters blowing in the light\nbreeze, I climbed up to admire his handiwork.</p>\n<p>I geared up, muttering supplications to the slight overhang above, and\nsoon was in the mix. Gently, the rock led me around it to the left,\nand a good bit of metal protected the move. It&#39;s funny, that just as\nwe get ourselves into these nerve-wracking situations, we&#39;re happy for\nall the help we can get, once truly confronted by a sickening drop and\na partner&#39;s worried expression!</p>\n<p>I built a gear anchor in a shaded little cove with an excellent view on\nthe climb so far. Steve arrived with a grin and a flotsam of slings and\nmetal. The next pitch was about 165 feet, so we expected to do some\nsimul-climbing. For you flatlanders, this means that the follower will\nbegin climbing before the leader has reached an anchor. This takes some\ntrust in your partner, since both of you are connected by the rope, and\nanchored to the rock only by the bits of protection the leader got in\non his way up. Steve had the lead, but a hard move repelled him, so we\ntraded places. I found here a perfect fist jam: slam your fist into the\ncrack, and flex it. Lean back and climb past, feeling each chip of sandstone\nand grit against your palm, hypersensitive for signs of slippage. </p>\n<p>The climbing eased off soon after, and I found myself admiring the\nsurroundings. The beautiful line we had ascended, the still canyon below\nand judgemental walls across from us. I had to slow down and savor this,\nthe best part of climbing: becoming aware of the dramatic position you\noccupy in the landscape, the tenuous and fragile nature of your residence\nthere, the silence and self-reliance of the lead. All this, crystalized\nin the moment, captured to be remembered forever.</p>\n<p>Fulfilled, I called out to Steve to slow down and absorb whatever energy\nthe pitch might offer him too. We took some pictures and drank water.\nSteve took off, climbing well on our vertical trail. He looked for the\n&quot;escape possible,&quot; finding only loose and uncertain gullies leading up to\nthe right. I fretted as I followed him, coming to a cool shaded belay cove.\nFrom his vantage point I saw it too - we&#39;d\nbe better off continuing the climb than venturing onto the &quot;escape.&quot;</p>\n<p>Girding up, I started out enjoying pitch 6, but after a resting ledge, I\nfaced a finger crack with no footholds that reminded me of Yosemite.\nA tough move brought me to a fixed Camelot, the only evidence we&#39;d seen\nyet that anyone else had ever been here. I clipped to it, and continued,\ngetting into uncertain terrain pretty quickly. Looking down, I saw I&#39;d\nclimbed well above the Camelot, with no chance of gear ahead. Blood\npounded in my ears, and my breath came shorter. I could feel my body\ntightening up! I had to shove it away - there was nothing to do but\nclimb on. Here a wall folded down on the crack, and we&#39;d call it a\nchimney. I could put my back against this wall, with feet on tiny\nnubbins opposite. Breathing regularly, I knew I was in the &quot;no falls\nallowed&quot; zone, and with forced calm, continued on. As soon as I gained\nthis control, I was out of the woods, with a &quot;Thank God&quot; hold on the\nopposite wall, and a step up to a bushy ledge. </p>\n<p>Regaining composure, I belayed Steve, advising him to attach the pack to\na sling below him, as the chimney got pretty tight. He got up, and I\nrelated my difficulties with the chimney. I was worried because the\nnext pitch was rated a bit harder, and I didn&#39;t feel ready for it. \nNeither was Steve, not having climbed as much this summer as I. I knew\nI needed to do it, but together, we turned something that could have been\nvery stressful into a positive experience. Making an effort to change\nour increasingly dark attitudes, and realizing that the steep, black\ncrack above was well protected (unlike what I&#39;d just encountered), we\nwere soon smiling again. Steve&#39;s encouragement after each tough move\npropelled me up, and I began to realize why pitch 7 is &quot;the best pitch\non the route.&quot; Well protected, and moderately streneous, the climber\nfeels safely attached, yet finds freedom in the puzzles each move\npresents. Black plates adhering to the surface of the light brown\nstone provided the occasional &quot;right on!&quot; hold. Finishing the pitch,\nI felt I had transcended a barrier. I had climbed through fear, into\nlight. It took my partner&#39;s psychic energy for this to take place. It\nwas a palpable force that sent me up the rock with energy to spare.</p>\n<p>We had both given a lot of ourselves here, and shared huge grins with\nthe canyon below!</p>\n<p>Getting down is another story in itself.
