{"date":"2001-5-13","title":"Dragontail Peak","blurb":"reached Pandora's Box","description":"<p>Steve, Chris and I hiked up to Colchuck Lake, thinking to climb the North\nButtress Colouir route on Colchuck Peak. But Steve&#39;s ankle was injured, and he\nturned back. Chris and I kept going, but gave up on the route due to the great\nheat and sugary snow. We continued up the glacier and climbed Pandora&#39;s Box. We\nwould have continued on to Dragontail&#39;s summit, but we ran out of time. Mostly\nbecause I&#39;m a slowpoke!</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/colmain.jpg\" alt=\"The classic view of Colchuck Peak from the lake.\">\n<img src=\"images/nbcroute.jpg\" alt=\"This is the North Buttress Colouir. It faces east, and receives sun very early. Best to start climbing it before dawn this late in the season, perhaps.\">\n<img src=\"images/glaclown.jpg\" alt=\"Clowning around on the Colchuck Glacier. Wow...sure is steep!\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/nicegull.jpg\" alt=\"Here is the gully you climb above Colchuck Col\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/chriskps.jpg\" alt=\"Chris on the summit of Pandora&#39;s Box, looking down at the Ingall&#39;s Creek valley.
