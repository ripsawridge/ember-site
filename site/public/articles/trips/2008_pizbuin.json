No fun at all! Finally at 11:30 am\nwe were ready to ski at the Biehlerhoehe, after a gondola and bus ride along\nthe closed high alpine tollway of the Montafon region.</p>\n<p>We skied across the big Silvrettasee, foolishly wearing skins on the skis. We\ndidn&#39;t realize how long the lake was. It took a full 30 minutes to get across.\nFinally though, we were skiing uphill at noon and our day could begin.</p>\n<p>We went slowly up the long valley as the sun burned through the morning clouds.\nChristian tested my German with some question and answer sessions. That was\npretty fun. We looked up to see the summit cross of the Silvrettahorn high\nabove, and turned to ski more steeply up to the Wiesbadener Hut. After a final\nsteep and boiling hot slope (yes, in February!) we arrived and checked into our\nrooms.</p>\n<p>After a Spetzi and some Apfelstruedel I was ready to go on to ski up the\nDreilaenderspitze. We just had to make sure to be back for dinner at 6. Skiing\naway, I was impressed by Christian&#39;s pacing. He went more slowly than I\nusually would, but then we went all the way to where we left our skis in one\nlong trip without stops. We hiked up onto the ridge, and soon had stunning\ndrop offs on both sides to keep us awake in the afternoon heat. Some steep\nsnow, and then tricky rock climbing near the end made it a real mountain climb.\nThere was barely room to stand on the summit, which marks a boundary between\nSwitzerland and two prefectures of Austria: Vorarlberg and Tirol.</p>\n<p>The way down was tricky, especially because of some rotting snow over slabs.\nChristian tried a new way on the shady north side of the ridge, but it had it&#39;s\nproblems too.</p>\n<p>I side-slipped down a fair ways, then made some turns. This wasn&#39;t so bad! The\nsnow was a-ok and we had a great, fast trip down the glacier. In only 15 or 20\nminutes we were back at the hut, sometime around 5:30. We had a pretty good\ndinner, but it was expensive. The hut cost 10 euros for the night, but the\ndinner and breakfast was another 20. Hmm, maybe better to bring food.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/pizbuin-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mountains to the south of the Bielerhoehe\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-2.jpg\" alt=\"Christian at the summit of the Dreilaenderspitze\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-3.jpg\" alt=\"The Schneeglocke as seen from the Wiesbadener Huette\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-4.jpg\" alt=\"Skiers pause on the way to the Ochsentaler Glacier\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-5.jpg\" alt=\"Our route goes right of the icefall, beneath the Silvrettahorn\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-6.jpg\" alt=\"Christian on the narrow summit ridge of Piz Buin\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-7.jpg\" alt=\"The view south from the Piz Buin\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-8.jpg\" alt=\"Michael on Piz Buin\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-9.jpg\" alt=\"Christian below a tricky, icy ledge on Piz Buin\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-10.jpg\" alt=\"The way back to the &quot;ski depot&quot; on Piz Buin\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-11.jpg\" alt=\"Majestic peaks to the north from the Silvrettahorn\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-12.jpg\" alt=\"Christian on the Silvrettahorn\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-13.jpg\" alt=\"Making our way up to the Rota Furka Pass, back into Austria\">\n<img src=\"images/pizbuin-14.jpg\" alt=\"Christian getting ready to ski down the Klostertal\"></p>\n<p>We were on our way at 7:30 Sunday morning, skinning up the valley to then\nclimb over a pass and get onto the Ochsentaler glacier. We passed another\nparty before dropping onto the glacier and then had things to ourselves\nfor a long time. Only when we reached the base of Piz Buin did some other\nparties come up. Leaving our skis, we set off with ice axes to make the 1000\nfoot climb of the summit block. About halfway there is a rock band, with\nsome ice-filled gullies offering a way through. I tried climbing it\ndirectly, but finally went back and put my crampons on. Christian managed\nwithout crampons. Once I was past that, there was an easy walk up a trail to\nreach the summit. Christian had already attained a fantastic view point on a\nsecondary summit. I took some pictures then joined him on the other side of\na pleasing sheer ridge. We had the world at our feet!</p>\n<p>On the way down I used crampons again for the ice, and soon we were back at\nour skis, zooming across the glacier to meet a ski trail going up to the\nSilvrettahorn. A pleasant ski up the hill for about an hour or less brought\nus to a pass which we could descent to the west for an interesting way\nhome. But we felt pretty good so we left the skis and set off for the\nsummit of the Silvrettahorn, up a mix of trails and snow, finally ending up\non a spectacular ridge crest. We saw a party traversing the ridge over to\nthe Schneeglocke, and wished we&#39;d brought our skis to do the same thing.\nOh well, next time! I admired the view down the east ridge, which is\napparently a great rock climb (though easy).</p>\n<p>A quick trip down, then we were skiing steeply down from the pass. Christian\nmade it look easy, but I had to do my share of kick turns! An easy trip down\nthe glacier got us in position for our last climb of the day, over the Rota\nFurka back into Austria. The steep south facing hillside had rotten snow\nwhich was hard to ascend sometimes. But eventually we made it, and enjoyed\nthe best snow of the trip on the north facing slopes down into the Klostertal.</p>\n<p>Descending this valley was easy and enjoyable. Back at the Silvrettasee, we\nglided along, though my ankle was too sore to skate. That cost me about 10\nminutes. It was 3:30 PM, we were a half-hour early for the last bus down,\nso we went to get a drink at the nearby restaurant.</p>\n<p>For some reason, people were standing in a miserable line for about 2 hours,\nwaiting for buses. Christian and I were smart and just waited at the bar.\nThen Christian felt the pressure and went to stand in the cold too. I\nsuccessfully resisted for 30 more minutes, then went down. 30 minutes of\nwaiting in a line, and we were on the bus, and the gondola shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>We&#39;d had such great weather and great exercise! Alas, we had to pay for our\nfun with another endless series of traffic jams. Christian drove the whole\ntime both ways, which amazed me. Thanks Christian!</p>\n"}
