It was great to meet him and chat about climbs we\nhave in common, restaurants, old friends. We headed out Friday morning to climb\nthe Kleine Trichter, a classic route on the West Face of the Hoher GÃ¶ll. It was\na new area for me, though I&#39;d long been told how cool this mountain was by\nHannes.</p>\n<p>We got there early and hiked up on rather wet asphalt. We arrived at a rather\nwet wall. But we had a good forecast, maybe the sun will burn the water away.\nHappily the first pitches were at an easy grade, and even soaking wet I thought\nwe&#39;d pull through okay. Even from the base we could see that the crux wouldn&#39;t\nnecessarily be the grade VII+ or A0 traverse on pitch 12, but sustained grade\nV+/VI- on pitches 7 and 8, which appeared to go right through a constriction\nthat even far below we could see acted as a water funnel.</p>\n<p>Due to an imposing moat we started 30 meters to the right, traversing into the\nroute one pitch up. Pitches of decent rock followed. I especially enjoyed the\ngrade IV pitch 3, and the IV- pitch 5. With rough rock and good holds, the\nwetness just added a bit of spice. But I got shut down hard halfway up pitch 7. \nLane belayed carefully below, as I reluctantly committed to soaking wet\nfootholds to get on the right side of a small overhang. From a little pillar, I\nneeded to go up and back left, continually on wet ground. Although the feet were\non rough-hewn rock, they were pretty much running with water, and the handholds\nsuddenly faced down and were even slimy.</p>\n<p>I fiddled for some protection, placing a micro-Alien that I had little faith\nin. I alternated between trying out different sequences and planning to go\ndown. Finally, strangely, I committed to the moves and with my heart in my\nthroat executed a sequence marked by a torqued foot jam and holds so marginal\nand wet that I couldn&#39;t breathe. I made it onto a pillar with one dry foothold\nand one dry handhold, surrounded by dripping water. I saw ridiculous ground\nabove, and a bolt to my left (this route had very little fixed protection). The\nsight of the bolt convinced me that this was my one chance to escape! But to\nclip it I had to be very calm. I spent about 5 minutes trying to recover and\nfigure out the right sequence to reach the bolt. Carefully, I made it there,\nclipping gratefully.</p>\n<p>Time to retreat! Lane lowered me on a traverse back to clean a couple cams at\nthe first pillar, then I climbed back to the bolt for a straight lower. Oh, the bolt\nwas also pretty rusty as this location is covered in water 3/4 of the year I\nguess. So that was creepy. I cleaned a small nut I&#39;d placed at the beginning of\nthe wet sequence and came down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/14369530699/\"><img\nalign=\"center\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3839/14369530699_892b322f06.jpg\"></a>\n<br><i>Lane on the wall</i><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/14552739531/\"><img\nalign=\"center\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2918/14552739531_b819497a3f.jpg\"></a>\n<br><i>The scary pitch that turned me back :D</i></p>\n<p>Alas! And we couldn&#39;t claim to be surprised either. I really need to understand\nthat west-facing walls have many strikes against them in early season. As Lane\nsaid, a south-facing wall would have rocked. We&#39;ll get another chance...</p>\n<p>We rappelled and sometimes downclimbed in order to reverse traverses. Our single\n60 meter rope did fine. After eating sandwiches, we decided to hang out at the\nsport-climbing crag at the base of the wall. </p>\n<p>We climbed a nice route (6a? 6b? Don&#39;t know) with a real sting in the tail on\nthe final clips. Beautiful pocket climbing gets you most of the way up, then\nthey run out and you need a big reach to get a little higher. Then you\nside-cling and under-cling finger cracks at an overlap. A hilarious reachy move\nto an amazing flake gets you to the anchor. Lane and I puzzled out the route,\nenjoying it quite a bit.</p>\n<p>We thought to do something else, but were intimidated by the <em>huge</em> runout to\nthe first bolt. Already being tired, we couldn&#39;t handle it. Everything else was\njust too hard. Alas...modern rock climbing!</p>\n<p>Lane and I will certainly climb something else later, he doesn&#39;t mind the long\ndrives from Northern Europe!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/14369536748/\"><img\nalign=\"center\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2937/14369536748_6ef1508bb0.jpg\"></a>\n<br><i>Lane at the base of the sport climb.</i></p>\n"}
