{"date":"2004-8-7","title":"Pickets Range Topos","description":"<p><em>back to <a href=\"pickets.html\">Picket Range Traverse</a>...</em></p>\n<p>Here is a detail of the lower section of Mt. Fury&#39;s North Buttress.\nIt can be approached from the left or the right. We chose to use the right\napproach, having heard that 5.9 chimney and face climbing could be required\non the left. Our route may have been a little easier, but we did encounter\nsome scary rockfall from &quot;The Mudslide&quot; above us, and climbed a pitch of \nhonest 5.8 face and crack climbing once on the buttress crest. We had so many\nideas about the best way to gain the crest that we invented a whole vocabulary\nof the region. Unprotected slab climbing below the Snowfinger was a mental\ncrux for me!</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/furydetail.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n<p>This is a great shot of Mount Terror&#39;s North Buttress. We called the snowfield\n&quot;The Kitty Cat,&quot; and our route was chosen by whatever looked easiest. I got\nanother &quot;mental crux&quot; pitch getting across a moat onto the rock, then \nAidan led two long simul-climb pitches to the &quot;clean dihedral,&quot; where Theron\ntook over, leading us up the crest. Eventually, the crest became too steep,\nand the &quot;5.8+ crux traverse&quot; provided the creepiest moves of the trip for me.\nTheron climbed that section a bit higher, finding an easier way. We think\nmaybe we stayed on the buttress crest for too long, and veering leftward\nearlier might have been the ticket. After that, 4 more long simul-climbing\npitches got us over the false summit where we could unrope, drop packs, and\nenjoy solid scrambling to the top! </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/terrordetail.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"}
