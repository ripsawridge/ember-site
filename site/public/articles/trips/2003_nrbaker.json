We began hiking at 1:15 am. A few hours sleep at the car gave us a surprising boost.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/earlystart.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Here we are at a dead end on the Coleman Glacier. Some crevasse-jumping got us on our way.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/onface.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Aidan and Theron climbing on the steep west slope of the north ridge.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/tocliff.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Old steps lead to the base of the ice cliff. There is at least one pitch of 60-70 degree ice here.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/somefolks.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Topping out on the first pitch, I look back. A party of four stops to watch.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/theronnaid.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Here&#39;s my buddies, they have my back.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/roosevelt.jpg\"><br>\n<i>The incredibly chaotic Roosevelt Glacier dominates us. We cling to a wall lest we fall in!</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/travpitch.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Aidan took a interesting way, leading us under dripping seracs to...more dripping seracs! For beta-masters, the climber going straight up is taking the quicker way.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/travpitch2.jpg\"><br>\n<i>I climb towards the ridge crest, humbled by the scale of the walls.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/backtonormal.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Two Alpinistas and the Roosevelt.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/upperslope1.jpg\"><br>\n<i>On the upper slopes.</i><br></center></p>\n<p>As Phil Fortier once said, &quot;The route was a lot more varied than I \nthought it would be - seemed like we were always travelling through \ninteresting terrain, winding among seracs, with lots of exciting exposure \nin places.&quot; \n(<a href=\"http://www.mtnphil.com/NorthRidge2/NorthRidge2.html\">source</a>).</p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/upperslope.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Phil was right.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/hallofgods.jpg\"><br>\n<i>What did we find here, in the hall of the mountain gods?</i><br></center></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/celticcross2.gif\" align=left>I don&#39;t have any summit pictures, \nas film was running low. We were on top at 12 noon,\nhanging out for an hour eating and naming peaks. A father of\nwilderness protection for the mountains at our feet has just died.\n<a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/116037_spring05.shtml\">\nIra Spring&#39;s</a> tireless efforts and enthusiasm made it possible for us to climb\ntoday. What will we do for the next generation? There are signs they prefer\nTV to this sort of thing. But then again, so did I. I&#39;m just trying to catch up.</p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/tiredroman.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Our vaunted strength finally ran out on the Roman Wall. Difficult footing in deep snow and incredible heat had their way with us. Aidan involuntarily sits, giving me an excuse to do the same.</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/longglissade.jpg\"><br>\n<i>There were some bright spots. Here, Aidan slides down glacier slopes. Signs at the trailhead warn against doing this with good reason. I slid carelessly right over a crevasse in the playground atmosphere of the lower slopes. Though I laughed with the passerbys, I knew I was lucky to escape injury.</i><br></center></p>\n<p>Here are a few other pictures: </p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/bbuttes.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Black Buttes</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/onface2.jpg\"><br>\n<i>A brief rest</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/seetheridge.jpg\"><br>\n<i>Our route</i><br></center></p>\n<p><br><br><center>\n<img src=\"images/postcard.jpg\"><br>\n<i>A retro postcard</i><br></center></p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>\n"}
