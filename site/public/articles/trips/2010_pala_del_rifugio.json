{"date":"2010-8-5","title":"Pala del Rifugio, \"Castiglioni/Destassis\"","blurb":"with Jesse","description":"<p>We decided to head down to the Pala Dolomites. We had time because Tuesday\nwas predicted to be bad weather everywhere. Actually it wasn&#39;t bad until\nevening, then there was a massive thunderstorm like we&#39;d never seen. The\nrain started as we made the short hike from the car to the Rifugio Treviso,\nwhich is right at the base of the climb. It didn&#39;t let up for hours, and\neventually tiny harmless streams on the mountainside turned into frightening\ntorrents with rolling boulders. Later, we met an American couple who were\nstranded by one of these torrents (certain death to try and cross), and\nforced to reclimb to a bivouac box 2000 feet above! I&#39;d never seen anything\nlike it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812188069/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4812188069_8510104674_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Our plan was to climb this route then continue along the West Ridge of\nSasso d&#39;Ortiga for a really grand day. But several things happened to derail\nthat. First, the hut warden may have been concerned about too many parties\ntrying to do the same route. He suggested we climb to the summit of Pala\ndel Rifugio via another route, a bit shorter but harder. He also pooh-poohed\nour request to get up really early, saying that the normal breakfast time\nshould be good enough. Perhaps feeling like we were behaving over-cautiously\nwe agreed to these changes.</p>\n<p>We set off in the morning with others, noting that vegetation and rock\nwere still soaked from the night before. After a tough 45 minutes we stood\nbelow the alternate route, not liking our chances at all. Above was a black,\ndripping chimney, supposedly the crux of the route at grade V+. Now I&#39;ve\nbeen in grade IV chimneys that scared me to death when soaked, and I lost\nmy desire to do battle with this thing very quickly. Jesse felt likewise.\nI was upset that our &quot;monster&quot; day might be taken from us due to bad advice\n(that I truly felt like ignoring before anyway, but didn&#39;t say anything).\nThe weather was beautiful...should we wait for the rock to dry? Should\nwe ignore the lower 16 pitches in favor of just doing the upper 9? I wanted\nto do neither, and immediately set off to speed down and get on our original\nroute in hopes of salvaging the day.</p>\n<p>We did this, but I&#39;d become kind of sour and uncommunicative as I mulled\nover all these factors. Jesse wanted to stop and talk it over a few minutes\nbut I wasn&#39;t hearing him. I&#39;d gotten the idea that it was &quot;my job&quot; to &quot;save\nthe day,&quot; and didn&#39;t see the use. My foolishness on this point cast a pall\nover the first hours of our climbing, and it was only after a long discussion\nlater that we could finally understand each other. I was abashed at having\nbeen disrespectful, and admired Jesse&#39;s forbearance and patience with me.\nI&#39;m always nervous until we are properly on the climb (my other friends\ncan attest to this too!), and really have to learn to take early setbacks\nin stride. The day is long...the chances for success are many...</p>\n<p>So anyway, we eventually made it to the other side of the mountain and\nthe Northwest Ridge. An Austrian (Styrian) party of four was getting ready\nto climb. Along with them, we scrambled the first two easy pitches, made\na little sketchy due to wet grass and rocks. They were very kind and offered\nfor us to go first. Two or three pitches of mediocre climbing led to a\nledge right of the ridge and an obvious chimney that must be one of the\ngrade V cruxes. I led this, very happy that it was dry! Another long pitch\nwith some simul-climbing, slightly easier, got to the First Shoulder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812814760/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4812814760_0f479af7a8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812815788/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4812815788_4e2fb539fd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Spirits lifting a bit, we simul-climbed easy terrain up to where the buttress\nsteepened again. Here, I made a route-finding error that had us climbing\na rather unpleasant variation for a few pitches. My topo said &quot;climb gully\nleft of the arete&quot; and showed a broad, deep &quot;gully,&quot; that could only be\nthe enormous gully right above us. I saw a face climb that could (if you\nsquint just right) be characterized as a very shallow gully. It looked\nbetter. I should have taken it. But I was a slave to (a poor interpretation\nof) the topo!</p>\n<p>So I led us into the dark gully, eventually a dark, dripping gully. While\nthe Styrians watched far below, telegraphing their opinion of my route\nchoice, I stemmed up to the crux: an 10-inch slot with smooth walls. In\na moment of unexpected (later) hilarity, Jesse was making small talk and\nI blurted out &quot;CANTTALKRIGHTNOW!&quot; surprising myself at the ragged edge\nof fear in my voice. I had one foot pasted on a sloping wall and was pawing\nunsuccessfully for anything positive above the slot that awkwardly held\npart of my body. I was too far above protection to prevent crashing onto\na ledge. Slow down and breathe. Eventually, micromovements that brought\nmy foot a couple of inches higher got me something I could use. I built\na gear belay and breathed the tension out, straining to see what we had\nabove us. Would overhangs choke us off?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812192031/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4812192031_c109934413_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Jesse came up and wished me luck. Happily, fears were overblown and we\nentered a realm of quality climbing again. After traversing a short vertical\nwall the sight of a piton cheered me up. A fun face climb with another\npiton allowed me to climb out of our &quot;massive gully&quot; and join the regular\nroute. Jesse came up and we looked sadly down what appeared to be nice\nclimbing to the right of our gully. We don&#39;t recommend our three pitch\n&quot;adventure variant!&quot;</p>\n<p>Soon we stood on the Second Shoulder, and it&#39;s only here, for the last\n4-5 pitches of the route that it becomes a wonderful Dolomiti climb. Swapping\nleads, we enjoyed steep terrain marked by enormous holds and lots of incredible,\nbomber natural protection (natural columns in the rock called Sanduhr,\nwhich you can wrap a sling securely around).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812822144/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4812822144_67a8b2462f_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812198521/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4812198521_c4cb61853a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812828362/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4812828362_e750759564_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>These pitches were amazing and we could smile now after all the hemming\nand hawing and difficulties below. On the summit we had an amazing vision\nof the Sasso d&#39;Ortiga behind us, looming like a smooth South American buttress.\nI quite wanted to continue, but eventually it became clear that we&#39;d miss\ndinner and stumble back pretty late. Now...I wish we had just done it...but\nat the time the thought of dinner did have a strong hold on us!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812829270/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4812829270_0b494c37d7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812204937/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4812204937_352624cfec_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We descended carefully, having to negotiate some extremely exposed 4th\nand low 5th class in tennis shoes. We would think &quot;man, this is a tough\ntraverse!&quot; and suddenly see a piton in front of our faces. &quot;I guess people\nbelay this?&quot; But with care, we made it through to the notch where the Sasso\nd&#39;Ortiga route begins. Firmly in descent mode, we bade it a reluctant farewell.</p>\n<p>On the way down we talked with another party who had done the climb we\ngave up on. Indeed, it had been tough in the lower part. We continued down\nto a good dinner and a reunion with the Styrian party. They had been very\nreticent, looking at us funny when we&#39;d say something (like &quot;hello&quot;). But\nnow they were different. Jesse described how we won them over in such a\nhilarious way: just relentless cheerfulness from both of us. Ignoring the\ncold or blank stares...offering advice about where to belay, etc. By the\nend, they were smiling too!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812209013/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4812209013_2ef2b323b9_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812213177/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4812213177_f6ba170b76_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>So this climb has some minor flaws. But I think it was good for us to\nhave some friction with each other because it was an opportunity to see\nhow we deal with conflict. We want to do bigger climbs together in the\nfuture, and having seen each other in a bad mood is already helpful for\nthat (well...Jesse saw ME in a bad mood. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever been in\na bad mood...that&#39;s a compliment people sometimes give me...but I&#39;ve met\nmy master in that regard!).</p>\n"}
