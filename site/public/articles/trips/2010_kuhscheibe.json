We were\nactually excited to do an ice climb, but the really warm weather in the last\nweek had a devastating impact on the ice. So, what to do? Go hiking! Which means\nskiing this time of year.</p>\n<p>Christian suggested skiing up the Kuhscheibe or one of the other peaks around\nthe Amberger Hut in the Stubai Range. I&#39;d never been over there, so it sounded\nlike a great plan. The drive was pretty long, factoring in two stops it took 3\nhours from Munich. I was surprised because most of the time my visits to the\nStubai Range are in the big Stubai Valley or the Sellrain Valley, each of which\nis just 2 hours from home. But this location on the west and south of the range\nis quite far, basically near the big Sölden resort skiing area. Oh well, we were\nskinning up the closed road at 9 am on a great blue sky day.</p>\n<p>There had been rain and snow the day before, and Sunday was predicted to be\nunsettled as well. Score one for us in the eternal battle with the weather gods!</p>\n<p>An hour and a half up the road, through pretty open country of the lower\nSulztal, and we reached the Amberger Hütte. &quot;How about some Apfelstrüdel,\nChristian?&quot; Never pass up a chance for sugary fuel, I thought. &quot;Sure!&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>As we ate we talked about peaks we wanted to climb. &quot;Charles and I are planning\nfor the Pallavicini Rinne on the Grossglockner in April or May, want to come?&quot;\nThree people for that trip would be better than two. We could share one rope and\none stove for the bivouac hut. We made rough plans and slowly the process of\ngenerating excitement for the summer season begins.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4392628033/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4392628033_67c47b62c5_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>In the Rosskar</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4393400578/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4393400578_15a730e868_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Above the Rosskar</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4393398652/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2679/4393398652_4c0257271a_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Small scale</em></p>\n<p>Back out in the sun we crossed part of the long flat Sulztal meadow, then\nfollowed a trail made that morning by some skiers (and a dog). It took us\nsteeply up the west valley wall and ultimately into a side valley called the\nRoßkar. Already the hut looked far away. We continued in here for a while, then\nthe track branched again. Going left and south, we climbed into a basin below\nthe Kuhscheibenspitze glacier. For a moment I thought we made a wrong turn, as\nit looked like our side valley ended in a rugged crest. But it was an\nillusion. A look at the map made clear a narrow gap that allowed us to climb\nonto the small (pocket) glacier. Up there we could see climbers on the summit\nridge, blowing spindrift all around them. &quot;Windy up there!&quot; We put on jackets\nand made the last switchbacks to the ski depot as the first descenders started\nmaking tracks down. A few minutes of climbing awkwardly in ski boots and we were\non the satisfyingly narrow summit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4393395880/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2571/4393395880_cc68ab44bb_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Schrankogel</em></p>\n<p>The Schrankogel was the dominating peak, off to our east, but many others vied\nfor attention, including those on the other side of the Ötz valley where we\ndrove in. We noticed that those peaks don&#39;t seem to get a lot of skiers\nattention, seeming quite rugged with steep valley flanks.</p>\n<p>Down we went, Christian making beautiful turns and me muddling along as best I\ncould. Later, I became unbalanced in the powdery snow and fell, losing a ski. I\ngrew alarmed as I combed the area, unable to find it! &quot;Oh man!&quot; I\nthought. Eventually it appeared, trampled beneath my steps in a particularly\ndeep area.</p>\n<p>Back to the hut for some coffee, then a rapid ski down to Christian&#39;s car in\nGries. Really nice day!</p>\n<p><b>Elevation gain/loss:</b> 1650 meters (~5400 feet)\n<b>Time:</b> 5 hours to summit, 7 hours total (1 hour hanging around the hut)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4393401814/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2689/4393401814_9a4c5b66c0_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Christian on the summit</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4393394900/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4393394900_0b1c80e2dc_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>On the summit of Kuhscheibenspitze</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4392632803/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4392632803_e722ac9971_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Looking down...</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4392633717/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2689/4392633717_dd8e5151f5_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>To the west</em></p>\n"}
