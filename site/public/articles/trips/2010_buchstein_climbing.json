We did &quot;Südwandschmannkerl&quot; (VI-) first. Fun, easy\nclimbing, with the best pitch being the crux VI- corner, involving stemming\nand a crack. We rappelled the route, then climbed &quot;Sähnestückchen&quot; (VII-),\na neighboring climb with an amazing first pitch of grade VI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4463912437/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2751/4463912437_d9db679a46_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4464689946/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4464689946_601fcbfc4d_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Improbable moves on a slab characterized it. The second pitch was the\ncrux, which I failed to master. It&#39;s at the third bolt, and was just a\nmystery how to step up to a shallow ledge above a vertical wall without\na positive handhold. The pitch above was very nice too. Alexander led out\nfor a long (V?) pitch with varied moves. Another long pitch led to an improvised\nbelay in a slippery snow gully. Trying to top out from here was difficult,\nwith various comical shinanigans. Eventually we grimaced and kicked steps\nin the snow in our rock shoes so as to enjoy the summit for a few minutes.\nWe soaked in the view then rappelled down, connecting with Südwandschmannkerl\nbecause there were a few belays without rap rings on Sähnestückchen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4463914031/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4463914031_6faf398178_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4463914805/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4463914805_86c0b7e946_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4463915175/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4463915175_dc4e2cffea_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>To close out the day I led the first pitch of Sähnestückchen, as watching\nAlexander lead it before was inspiring.</p>\n"}
