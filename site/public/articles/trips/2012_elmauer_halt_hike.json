{"date":"2012-9-16","title":"Elmauer Halt hike","description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993404036/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8460/7993404036_cf89174f81.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a>My\nformer neighbor Riki had been trying to climb up the Elmauer Halt for more\nthan a year, enduring bad weather, trips with folks who were scared of\nheights and other woes. She enlisted me to go earlier in the summer and\nfinally a day arose when we could juggle busy schedules and meet up. She\ndrove her family&#39;s beautiful new black Nissan and we got to the trailhead\nwith no traffic at all. I always forget what a fast hiker Riki is, and\nwithin 40 minutes, we were at the Gruttenhütte, advertised by trail signs\nto take an hour and a half! I&#39;d made her promise not to worry too much\nabout timing, but just to enjoy ourselves. (Riki and I used to only do\n&quot;dawn patrols&quot; together, racing back to town before 10 am after hiking\nor skiing). But nobody told her legs that :D.</p>\n<p>So it wasn&#39;t much longer and we were above the hut, hiking through a boulderfield\non fresh snow, and talking about the usual parent topics of kids, kids\nallowances, toys, and all that stuff only fascinating to the be-kidded\nlike us! It&#39;s always nice to get another perspective on the whole perplexing\nthing. I told some stories about Rowan and Elijah and how different they\ncan be from each other.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, we found the trail again (I&#39;d led us off into a wilderness\nof snow and rock), then climbed more steeply to the beautiful trail that\ntraverses above and below cliffs almost magically to the  Rote-Rinne\nScharte (&quot;Red Gully Pass,&quot; imaginatively named). We continued on steeper\nground, now following an iron cable to mark the way on good rock. Fresh\nsnow had made things a bit slippery however. We were constantly surprised\nby how greasy the rock felt with our wet shoes. I would take two (<em>hilarious!</em>)\npratfalls on the descent because of this. Below the Scharte, we climbed\non loose rock rather than follow the &quot;contrived&quot; ladder of iron steps hammered\ninto the rock a few feet above the general slope. This was a fun diversion,\nhowever, my be-velcroed camera decided to let go from my pack in here,\nand say goodbye after 6 wonderful years into the red maul of the Rote-Rinne\nScharte! Goodbye camera! I...loved you!</p>\n<p>It&#39;s time had come. I was thinking about buying a new one for a while,\nand maybe now was the time. Any advice? It was a Panasonic Lumix, circa\n2006 vintage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993382715/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8322/7993382715_32d7651b4e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993384717/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8312/7993384717_1e1ff10dc4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We continued on enjoyable scrambling terrain, eventually reaching a fun\nladder. Above this, we scrambled further to the summit and enjoyed great\nviews in all directions. The recent snow was melting, but the great alpine\nchain to the south presented a stunning sight: a broad snowline extending\nalong the chain showing that the mid-week snow had been quite extensive.\nWould it fully melt? After all, it was only mid-September.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993395654/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8458/7993395654_d6f8aabe89.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993387365/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8035/7993387365_bea082a021.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993388015/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8461/7993388015_23b72ba62e.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I tried to smoke my pipe on top, but after 5 matches in a weak wind I\ngave up! Oh well. We had nice sandwiches, identified Riki&#39;s parents house\n(approximately), and talked about Greece. After a good long time, we headed\ndown, running into dozens of people climbing up. It truly is the most popular\nhike in the Wilder Kaiser. We were glad to have the mountains to ourselves\non the way up, especially because we saw herds of <em>gämse,</em> grazing near\nthe boulderfields.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993398822/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8302/7993398822_73073b3cab.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993390799/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8460/7993390799_1f2eb77f38.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993401374/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8175/7993401374_26d677481b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993393285/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8307/7993393285_095075339c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>After my pratfall-laced descent, we went to the Gruttenhütte, having drinks,\nsoup and pie. It was so crowded we had to go sit on a grassy ledge away\nfrom the hut, bedeviled only by children running around behind us. The\nwhole trip had a feeling of a year &quot;summing up,&quot; and this good extra rest\non the descent reinforced that. Now we talked about jobs and all their\nfoibles.</p>\n<p>Within 30 minutes we were back at the car, stopping only to buy a pumpkin\nfor Frederik and Heidi. I figured I&#39;d wait until closer to Halloween to\nget one.</p>\n<p>Thanks Riki for a great hike, ca-ching, another Kaiser trip in the bank!!\n(Fleischbank, that is! (this is an insider Wilder Kaiser joke (no it&#39;s\nnot (okay, fine)))).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993405022/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8447/7993405022_76f0045cce.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>A last look at the Elmauer Halt</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7993396509/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8436/7993396509_de5ac37f65.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Purchase of Pumpkin (one)</em></p>\n"}
