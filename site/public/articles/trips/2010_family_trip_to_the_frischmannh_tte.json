{"date":"2010-8-29","title":"Family trip to the Frischmannhütte","description":"<p>Kris, Rowan, Elijah and I headed to the mountains at 8 am Saturday morning.\nWe had no traffic and got to the little town of Köfles on a mountainside\nin the Ötztal in 3 hours. The boys had packs this time, and as usual felt\na bit tired in the first few hundred meters. In fact, Elijah said &quot;Daddy,\nI&#39;m <strong>tired</strong>&quot; less than 10 seconds after we set out with great fanfare!</p>\n<p>But it&#39;s almost always just a problem with boredom for these fellas. We\ncame into a forest with boulders to hop on and he forgot he was tired.\nThere was a monotonous ski slope that gave them some trouble, but as I&#39;ve\nseen before, they got onto the steeper switchbacking trail above and had\nno problem maintaining motivation. Well, as long as the parents are creative!\n&quot;No pooping on my red hat,&quot; said mommy. &quot;No pooping under my blanket!&quot;\nchuckled Rowan. &quot;No p---&quot; you get the idea. That was a joke that lasted\nfor hours. Plus it got the boys some exercise on prepositions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916823465/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4916823465_965dd4c3a9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>I&#39;m a huge Jethro Tull fan...Rowan brought the flute!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916825369/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4916825369_79cbe69579.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Elijah points to the car, and Rowan to the hut</em></p>\n<p>After a long time we reached a high pass called Schartle, then began a\nmagical mostly traversing journey along an cute little irrigation canal,\nbringing glacial blue water down to some cows in the valley below. We stopped\nfor lunch along the water, and looked to our hut, the Frischmannhütte,\non the other side of the valley. We made a long traverse to the head of\nthe valley, crossed a raging stream, then continued to the hut, getting\nthere at about 5:30. Wow, that was a pretty big hike!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916837179/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4916837179_849908bb6b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917439516/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4917439516_d224f6f78d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916840057/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4916840057_8640e2de40.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917443216/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4917443216_c871dd3b8d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917444948/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4917444948_b2e3241b25.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916846219/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4916846219_b7e74b00c2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We would sleep in a common room with about 8 other people. That was a\nfirst for the boys, but they did great. Dinner was served early, like 6\nor 6:30, and was very good. I had &quot;Rahmschnitzel,&quot; fried pork with cream\nsauce and rice. The boys had spaghetti which always works.</p>\n<p>Later, we put the boys to bed and went down into the &quot;Stube&quot; so I could\nget a beer and Kris some wine. I saw a guitar on the wall and decided to\nbe sociable and join in the music-making. A whole group from northern Bavaria\nwere there with a father and son with their own accordians. They happily\naccepted my strumming and we spent a couple of hours going through dozens\nof songs. They have amazing memories. I just played along by ear...some\nsongs had two chords, some three...rarely four. Kris loved it, and we kept\ndrinking, though we could never keep up with this group! We got some good\nGerman practice, and finally, after a encore rendition of &quot;Kleine Harmonica\nSpieler&quot; we went to bed. I was bragging I&#39;d get up real early and climb\nthe Blockkogel before anyone else finished breakfast. No one believed me,\nleast of all me!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916849969/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4916849969_b8c7a0dc97.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917453320/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4917453320_6d693d6d69.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916854507/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4916854507_16804dce2c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917457220/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4917457220_bac157baf2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>But I managed it. For some reason I was awake at 6:00, kissed Kris goodbye\nand stumbled out. I didn&#39;t feel I had time to even drink water, put on\ncontact lenses or snatch my iPod. Normally those are the three essentials\nfor a morning hike!</p>\n<p>I scurried away, hiking to the back of the valley then steeply up a long\nscree cone, past some startled sheep, then onto a scenic ridge to meet\nthe sun. Another 30 minutes and I was heading due south on the north ridge\nof the Blockkogel, really loving the variety of the route and the views.\nOn the summit I looked down into the Pitztal, and across and out to many\nsnowy peaks. The air was exceptionally clear. This was great, because it\ncan sometimes be very hazy in good weather. It felt like summer was turning,\nand must be enjoyed before it slips away.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916869823/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4916869823_0da991f3b3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Goodbye hut...</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917468322/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4917468322_a54d9aa61c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916860697/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4916860697_abc4e7c8ed.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Blockkogel</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916862573/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4916862573_33d60d7523.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Views to the west...</em></p>\n<p>Back at the hut, Elijah was keen to explore some rocks across a stream.\nHe led us further and further to my weak protests that mom was ready to\ngo. The boys loved finding spider webs and destroying them with rocks.\nRowan climbed down into a little cave once it had been sufficiently cleared\nof spider webs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916871939/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4916871939_4d73a3f15b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Fighting spider webs...</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917476322/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4917476322_74711a3797.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Sporting my injury from the Langkofeleck two weeks before...</em></p>\n<p>The hike back was made interesting because cows were coming from the lower\nand upper pastures to the hut. We had to wait on the side of the trail\nfor them to pass. After a while, this got annoying, but finally at the\nraging creek we were done with that. It seemed a long way down, especially\nin the steep rock and forest slope above Köfles. Kris and I were tired!\nBut finally we made it, and had a nice drive home, fortified by McDonalds\nnear Munich.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4917481780/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4917481780_2fd9858aea.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Traffic jam...</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916885853/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4916885853_f82d1efcb4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916887635/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4916887635_306022e3fc.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Blockkogel and our hut on the right.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4916892623/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4916892623_ca967f6cb9.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Beautiful mom and kids!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4921278800/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4921278800_d72c1738d3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Bye Austria!</em></p>\n<p><em>More photos <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157624658546529/with/4916823465/\">here</a></em>.</p>\n"}
