{"date":"2003-6-16","title":"Lembert Dome","description":"<p><h2>Northwest Books (5.6)</h2></p>\n<h3>June 16, 2003</h3>\n\n<p><em>back to <a href=\"cali.html\">Sierras</a>...</em></p>\n<p>This climb was very short (two pitches) but enjoyable too.\nIt&#39;s right across the street from the grill and market in Toulumne Meadows.\nWe had arrived in the area late in the afternoon, and had time to\nspend an hour climbing before eating dinner and settling in to camp.</p>\n<p>We hiked through light forest on the edge of the dome, and found the likely\nstart of the route. Scrambling up slabs brought us to a ledge where I\ncould belay Aidan as he climbed the first pitch. Slabs led to a \ndistinct corner, and nice lieback moves led to another belay ledge\n(50 meters). Fun easy climbing on solid granite!</p>\n<p>For the second pitch, I made an &quot;attention-getting&quot; rightward traverse\non steep rock over to cracks and corners that led directly up.\nI thought the difficulties were over, but an awkward wide crack had\nto be climbed to another ledge. Twenty more feet of climbing led to\nthe belay ledge, and a scenic view of the Meadows. We scrambled to the summit,\ntried to identify peaks in our new home, then headed down.</p>\n<p>As the slabs steepened, I prefered staying left where the angle wasn&#39;t as\ndramatic. We split up, and then met up again 10 minutes later near the car.\nIf you are just passing through, and have an hour to spare, climb the\nNorthwest Books!</p>\n<p></td></p>\n<p><td width=\"30%\" valign=top></p>\n<p><table></p>\n<p><tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/lembert.jpg\"><img src=\"images/lembert.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Aidan on the first pitch</i></p>\n"}
