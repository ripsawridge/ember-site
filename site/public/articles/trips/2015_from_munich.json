{"date":"2015-1-31","title":"From Munich to Dietramszell","blurb":"long, long walk","description":"<p><em>25 miles on snowy roads...</em></p>\n<p>I was keen to walk to Bad Tölz, but I wasn&#39;t sure if I could handle the enormous distance.\nIt snowed heavily overnight, so I set off, crunching south by the Zoo, then turning\naway from the river before Grünwald into the Perlacher Forst. This provided a long\njourney along a train track in deep snow. Thankfully a few people had made tracks\nor my socks would be even wetter than they ended up. I reached Oberhaching and\ngot confused, actually walking out of my way to downtown Deisenhofen before\nrealizing my mistake. I&#39;d had enough of deep snow on trails, so I would stick to\nthe road for the rest of the journey.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16386769036'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7405/16386769036_295c51c8df_b.jpg'></a>\nEndlhausen</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16226829567'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8673/16226829567_a268a21007_b.jpg'></a>\nMountains!</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16225090088'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8650/16225090088_355a54b78e_b.jpg'></a>\nI approach Endlhausen</p>\n<p>I think this made it harder on my feet, because pavement is tougher than dirt trails.\nI walked to Oberbiberg, where I took my first rest. The snow covered all benches and\nsurfaces, making it hard to find a rest stop. Here, I found a bench on the southern\nexposure of a building where I could take off my shoes and eat a peanut butter\nsandwich. Ah, that felt good.</p>\n<p>In general, I didn&#39;t see a soul in these little towns, and in 25 miles of walking I\nonly saw one person outside of the crowded trail along the Isar: a man walking his\ndog in the Perlacher Forst. Out here in the towns there were neither people nor\nbusinesses where I could get a cup of coffee. I didn&#39;t see a gas station until\nDietramszell, and it was closed, too. So I was glad I brought plenty of food and\nwater.</p>\n<p>I walked on, taking another rest in Fraßhausen, where a business sold little garden\nsheds, and had an &quot;example&quot; bench to sit on. Yes! Somewhere in the deserted town\nI heard a TV playing, and someone turned down the volume when I made a noise.\nStrange.</p>\n<p>In Linden, I stopped on a cold, wet bus bench for a few moments, realizing that I\nhad blisters and was so sore that getting up and moving was becoming a real chore.\nI thought about stopping at Dietramszell. So, indeed, that last stretch felt long.\nI went to the restaurant across the street from the big church at the center of\ntown and had a cup of coffee and a great slice of apple and walnut pie. The walnuts\nmade for a very cosy small town touch.</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16410977511'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8675/16410977511_519e176915_b.jpg'></a>\nA road near Frasshausen</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16226830737'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7444/16226830737_545fc35a95_b.jpg'></a>\nStill going...</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16412746365'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7383/16412746365_6a559ac57c_b.jpg'></a>\nLots of road walking</p>\n<p>I went outside and looked at the bus sign. and one would be along in 15\nminutes. To kill the time I walked back north up the hill for a few stops, then\nI noticed that the bus was late. Sigh. Reading the sign more closely, it only\nran on weekdays.</p>\n<p>Sigh!</p>\n<p>So...what to do? I called Kris and bitched and moaned on her voice mail,\nthinking she maybe needed to come pick me up. But I decided to try hitchhiking\nfirst. I held out my thumb, smiled, and promptly five cars drove by. But a man\nstopped! We had a great conversation about x-country skiing, walking, and the\ndifficulty of having a girlfriend who likes to walk when you like to ride bikes!\nHe brought my all the way home to my door, 40 kilometers away! This was amazing\nbecause I was hurting all over.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The very idea of this hike was a challenge for me in a few ways. First off, the\ngreat enemy: Boredom. I&#39;ve spent my whole hiking career being terrified of roads\nand flat country. Here, I&#39;m embracing both. The motivation came from the desire\nto begin the adventure right from the door, instead of after several hours\nfighting traffic, paying tolls, putting in gas, etc. Plus, I&#39;m losing patience\nwith that former self who looked down on one kind of outdoor experience while\nelevating others. I&#39;m getting interested in inward journeys, and sometimes the\nbest rewards there are when you don&#39;t have to concentrate on the path especially\nhard. </p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16386772896'>\n<img src='https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7340/16386772896_261b6be0b7_b.jpg'></a>\nLovely trees</p>\n<p><a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/55338612@N00/16386774556'>\n<img src='https://farm9.static.flickr.com/8657/16386774556_d868a4c82c_b.jpg'></a>\nResting in Frasshausen</p>\n<p>I was all loaded up with music and audiobooks for the perceived horror of the\nflatlands. But I didn&#39;t listen to anything until Deisenhofen. The first three\nhours were exciting just because of the new terrain. For example, I&#39;d never been\nin the Perlacher Forst.</p>\n<p>Later, I enjoyed the beauty of the trees with their mantel of fresh snow. At one\npoint, gazing deep into the forest on the side of the road was so much fun, I\nremember being very impressed with the beauty of a wall of trees decorated with\nsnow. It swirled off in powdery wisps of the wind.</p>\n<p>Seeing the mountains for the first time was a great moment as well. They looked\nhuge, and amazingly close. In reality, they were just foothills. But the\ncontrast with the long road and forest was great enough that it made an\nimpressive vision. </p>\n<p>So, maybe next time I&#39;ll make it. In truth, I want to walk to Bad Tölz, climb\nthe mountain behind for an elevation gain of 1000 meters, then take the train\nhome. But gee, that will be tough!</p>\n<p>Here was my &quot;workout&quot; on <a href=\"http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/861266759\">MapMyRun</a>.</p>\n"}
