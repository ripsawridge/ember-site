{"date":"2001-9-27","title":"Lundin Peak East Ridge","description":"<p>September 27, 2001</p>\n<p>Peter and I had a few hours before work, so we met at a park-n-ride\naround 4 am. Bleary-eyed, and wondering what the hell we were doing,\nwe drove to Snoqualmie Pass and stumbled out. A long somnolent stumble\nup Commonwealth Basin took us to Red Pass. The area was dusted with\nnice, sleepy new snow. I followed Peter up to a false summit of\nLundin, and looked across at the still-snoring true summit. Peter set\nup a rappel down an exposed gully, and wrapped me in swaddling clothes\nfor my descent. At the bottom, I unhooked from the rope and took my\nblanket over to a narrow ridge to wait. He fell asleep while coiling\nthe rope, so I carried him a ways along the ridge, snoring like a\nbaby! This tuckered me out, so I crawled into his backpack for a\nnap. He was looking for me at the belay for the short, easy pitch\nbelow the summit!  Little did he know I was safely coddled right\nthere! With a start, I awoke and silently belayed him on the rock\nstep. On the summit, Peter set up a hauling system and I unclipped the\nbig bolts as I was lifted even with them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"images/lundin.jpg\" alt=\"Lundin Peak from a false summit\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/peterledge.jpg\" alt=\"Peter coming around the mountain, driving 6 white horses\">\n<img src=\"images/routelun.jpg\" alt=\"Looking back to Red Pass\">\n<img src=\"images/plaque2.jpg\" alt=\"Memorial to a fallen climber (placed by the WAC)\">\n<img src=\"images/register.jpg\" alt=\"Michael signing the register\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/lunsummit.jpg\" alt=\"Peter and I, ready for work\"></p>\n<p>After a short nap, I was feeling tired, and wanted a nap. It was like a dream up there. I think\nwe bounded down the south face, bouncing on the pillowy, velvet rocks. I heard giggling all\nthe way to the car, where we got some real rest on the way back. G&#39;night!</p>\n"}
