{"date":"2005-3-12","title":"Baring Peak","description":"<p>The babies were sleeping semi-soundly, but too much fumbling in\nthe dark would alert them. I must forgo the headlamp near the nightstand, as\nclumsy fingers might knock over various glasses and nostrums!</p>\n<p>Hurtling into the gloom, I stuffed gaiters, a fraying sweater and a powerbar into a pack. I would have brought Jeff&#39;s guidebook, but it was also in the Room of\nSoft Sleepers, so I mentally traced the picture as the RAV4 careened through\nGold Bar. Once before I&#39;d tried to\nclimb the peak after work, but merely got some exercise climbing to the forested\nridge crest as dusk arrived.</p>\n<p>I started hiking at 7 am, after a brief chat with some fellows going to climb\nMerchant Peak. After a short walk on the abandoned road, the steep muddy path\nwas a shock to the system. Squelching along, I took solace in my iPod and\nSteve Reich&#39;s &quot;Music for 18 Musicians.&quot; The pulsing woodwinds and voices lended\na much-needed sense of mystery to the woody rooty ankle stretching journey.</p>\n<p>Eventually I was cruising along the gentle ridge crest, getting that great\nridge feeling despite a heavy scrim of trees. Ridges are a gift to mankind.\nSoon a bit of flagging marked an indistinct path leading steeply upslope.\nIt was an enjoyable trip through open forest, culminating in a ridgetop with\nthe first view of a broad snowy gully between the North and South summits.\nI found myself wishing for crampons on the rock hard snow of the morning.\nIt slowed me down quite a bit, trying to stay in the posthole steps of\npreview climbers, alternating with (mostly ineffective) attempts at step kicking.\nAt a dramatic saddle, I followed tracks left up a steeper section of snow\nto a &quot;staging area&quot; with great views of the South summit rock walls. I was\nhoping the snow would soften a little for the trip down!</p>\n<p>Bits of forest path alternated with snow patches for several hundred feet \nuntil reaching a rock gully below the summit. I scrambled up to a great\nview in all directions. It was 9:30 am. I called home, everyone was happy and\nwell-fed. I left a message for Carlos. I got the idea for a &quot;cell phone club&quot;\nwhere people relay calls from one mountaintop to another at some time, like\n10 am on Saturday for example. I ate the uninspiring PowerBar. I was happy to\nbe here, it completed the &quot;triumvate&quot; of Wild Sky Peaks for me, since I&#39;d\nclimbed Gunn and Merchant before. Okay, better head down.</p>\n<p>Pretty soon I got lost, because I was lured into secure post-hole steps I\nhadn&#39;t seen on the way up. They wandered along a rock wall and dead-ended at a\ncliff. Darn. I fooled around a while, then climbed back up a ways to probe\nfor the error. Back on the trail I worried about the steep hard snow ahead.\nBut some softening had occurred, so I could kick the occasional step and not\nhave to resort to &quot;chopping.&quot; On the way down the snowy gully I met a large\nparty coming up, well-shod in crampons which I envied. Bumping and slipping my way\ndown, I was happy to be off the snow and moving quickly to the sounds of\nPink Floyd tearing down the wall. </p>\n<p>Ah, the long semi-controlled fall down to the road, finally reaching the car at\n12:30. There was still time to take the boys to Green Lake for a walk around,\na fun visit with friends, then a Red Mill Burger. Something had to give though,\nI crashed hard before giving the fellas a bath. I don&#39;t know how Kris got everyone\nbundled and sleepy while my snores echoed metallicly in the bedroom. Gnight!</p>\n"}
