It was Sunday\nmorning, and there is a beautiful little chapel up there:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855322019/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2855322019_08d53b27e3_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>There was a church service going on! Somber horns were playing, and the\npriest and all the listeners were standing outside. We went up close to\nlisten a while. Both boys were very quiet. It was a neat place. We sat\nand looked out at the Tegernsee and the neat plains of green stretching\naway to the north. Here are some more pictures:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855322639/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/2855322639_59de30384a_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855323115/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/2855323115_6494717040_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855323553/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3194/2855323553_7b3d15493a_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856158574/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3001/2856158574_50bbaf713a_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>All of the pictures from Mom&#39;s trip can also be seen easily <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157607284549121/\">here</a>.</p>\n"}
