{"date":"2007-2-17","title":"The Kramerspitze","blurb":"with Steve Knipple","description":"<h2>Snow hike with Steve</h2>\n\n\n<p>Steve K. and I went for a morning hike on the Kramerspitze. Steve lived in\nPortland before Munich, and we had a lot of hikes in the Columbia Gorge in\ncommon. Now a very busy father of three boys, he hasn&#39;t been able to hike\nmuch. So it was a great boon that we had a blue sky morning to do it.</p>\n<p>We made quick progress on the lower trail, as it was completely snowfree. This\nis very unusual for this time of year! We were quite high when we finally hit\npermanent snow, and then slowed down some. We had a turn around time of 10 am,\nso we reached the ridge crest around that time and called it good. We sat and\nlooked around, enjoying the scenery very much.</p>\n<p>On the way down, we stopped at the hut for a Radler. What a cool morning out!</p>\n<table>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/viewtosummit.jpg\"><img src=\"images/viewtosummit.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The summit was still a ways away</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/ontheway.jpg\"><img src=\"images/ontheway.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>A snowy perch</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/steveridge.jpg\"><img src=\"images/steveridge.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Steve at our highpoint, the ridgecrest</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/kessel.jpg\"><img src=\"images/kessel.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Loisach caldron, with Garmisch-Partenkirchen</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/gettinghigher.jpg\"><img src=\"images/gettinghigher.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Along the way</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/hoellentalfar.jpg\"><img src=\"images/hoellentalfar.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>The Hoellental with the Waxenstein in front.</i>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=\"images/contemplatin.jpg\"><img src=\"images/contemplatin.jpg\"></a><br>\n<i>Steve at a perch to contemplate the world</i>\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n"}
