{"date":"2008-9-19","title":"Bad Hindelang","description":"<p>Mom, Kris, the boys and I stayed in Bad Hindelang for 5 days. This is\nin the Allg√§u Mountains of Germany/Austria. We were just on the German\nside. They are not very high, and in our area were mostly forested peaks\nwith outcroppings of limestone. But nearby they get pretty exciting. It&#39;s\na beautiful area where, especially in winter, you can find real solitude\n(despite what everyone says, yes it&#39;s true, even in Germany!). I&#39;ve been\nthere a few times for climbing or snowshoeing. <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/375128/A-Pleasant-Solitude.html\">Here</a> is\nmy account of a snowshoeing trip there alone last January. And <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/trip-report/286714/Sunny-South-Sides.html\">here</a> is\nmy trip report describing a couple of days of rock climbing a year ago.\n<a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/area/range/154588/allg-u-alps.html\">Here</a>is a nice page on Summitpost about the range along with a <a href=\"http://www.summitpost.org/object_list.php?object_type=4&amp;distance_4=20&amp;distance_lat_4=47.40780&amp;distance_lon_4=10.27810&amp;map_4=1&amp;is_open=1\">map</a>.</p>\n<p>We rented a &quot;Ferienwohnung&quot; or &quot;vacation apartment.&quot; This is very popular\nin Europe. This way you have a kitchen and can cook your own dinners, because\neating out is expensive. You get to become a regular resident of the town\nfor a while.</p>\n<p>We stayed right in the center of Bad Hindelang. There was an excellent\ngrocery store in walking distance, along with a bakery and some gift shops.\nNot much else! Though Mom and I had a really interesting walk through the\ncemetary behind the church. The gravestones were very beautiful. There\nseemed to be plenty of tragedies, especially one set of linked graves where\nthree teenage boys died, probably in a car accident.</p>\n<p>There was also an amazing greek restaurant. We had our favorite meal there,\nand Mom used the leftovers for days! Once we got pizza from next door,\notherwise, we just let dinners come together in an ad hoc way at the last\nminute, with varying, but mostly good results.</p>\n<p>Almost every night around 6 pm the cows would be driven through town from\npastures on the valley floor into barns scattered around. That was very\ninteresting! Here is Mom remarking on that:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856166860/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2856166860_e6f02c9e0e_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Here was the view on our balcony:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856160688/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3147/2856160688_c52c589d10_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856161156/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2856161156_f74f69a19a_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>And here was the general look of the countryside:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856162072/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3108/2856162072_7708e6dcb5_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855334461/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2855334461_bbd3157967_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Mom took this picture of me and the boys playing in a cow pasture. They\nwere very good and running but dodging cow manure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856170870/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/2856170870_358b3096ae_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>One day we headed south to a mountain with a ski lift and a kind of sled\nyou can ride down on tracks:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855328635/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/2855328635_0a5db8bcb4_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855327243/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/2855327243_b14ebfc70b_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855329775/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3269/2855329775_144e459894_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Afterwards we had an expensive but delicious lunch on the mountain. Mom\ngot something with <em>pfefferlingen</em> mushrooms, and I got a steak. I don&#39;t\nremember what Kris got, but darn it, the poor girl doesn&#39;t usually find\nsomething she likes :-(. Elijah loves his train called &quot;Diesel,&quot; and made\nme take pictures of it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856165084/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3202/2856165084_874710c942_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855330849/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2855330849_923a04709c_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856164686/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3040/2856164686_40e279e6e8_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>On the last day we went to another mountain summer-sled, which promised\nto be the longest in Germany. It was so much fun we did it twice. It was\nreally, really, really fun! We tried to get Mom to try, but she told us\nhow much she enjoys <em>observing</em>.</p>\n<p>This was also the first time the boys rode a real ski lift, the kind they\ncould jump out of if they went crazy. Happily they didn&#39;t go crazy :-).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856178208/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3232/2856178208_45303639bd_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856178446/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/2856178446_db581efcbf_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2855343247/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3012/2855343247_03a9e7d0d6_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/2856178968/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/2856178968_22442cc11b_m.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n"}
