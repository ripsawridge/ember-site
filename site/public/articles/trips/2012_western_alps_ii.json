I only selected the best pictures. There are about 25 of them for this segment. Georg and I took over 700 pictures!</i></p>\n<p>Showered and restored, we asked the next logical question: what about the weather. It was raining outside the Belvedere! That won&#39;t do. So we looked east, and found an island of sun around the Gran Combin. There was an enticing ice route, the Northwest Face, and descent via a nearby ridge of rock. Georg paid Kiki and we drove off. We stopped at a climbing store to try and buy a helmet for him. Rockfall on the Hochferner in May had dislodged the inner styrofoam of his helmet, making it a two-piece unit. Surprisingly, we were unable to find a decent helmet in the Chamonix valley. They all seemed to be strange brands, and sat very high on the head &quot;mushroom-like.&quot; I didn&#39;t blame him for sticking with his old helmet. I on the other hand found an exciting new backpack, the Black Diamond Epic, which allowed me to store crampons outside among other features.</p>\n<p>The hike to the Valsorey Hut was pretty long, but pleasant. It had rained in this valley, but clouds were lifting to reveal broad green slopes that were restful after the Aiguilles. We stopped to rest in a sheep-filled meadow and admired Monte Velon on the other side of the valley, a peak that marks the border with Italy. We joked about Martigny as a steampunk industrial hub of concentrated decay, extracting value from it&#39;s hinterland in the meanest possible ways. We riffed on an Italian tunnel under Velon, and were generally silly. A short but steep walk to the hut finally tired us out, and we admired the rocky side of the Gran Combin, steaming above in remnant clouds like Vesuvius. After a spartan dinner, we slept.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gran-combin-nw-face-d-\">Gran Combin, NW Face (D-)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875764290/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7128/7875764290_4d7ab7a1cd_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg with Mont Blanc behind</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875772688/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8302/7875772688_8229edb1f5_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael prepares for the next lead</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875776594/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8303/7875776594_c355aca81c_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg heads off alone to tag the remote Tsessette summit.</em></p>\n<p>3 am found us leading a train of climbers up to a high col. We dropped down on\nthe north side while they climbed the rocky ridge. Now we traversed glacial\nslopes looking for our ice way. Crossing a large bergschrund, we actually stood\nbelow it but didn&#39;t believe it, chosing to traverse slowly east on tricky\nground. Finally we realized our mistake and went back halfway, settling for a\ntraversing ascent up the ice shield. Deploying the rope, we climbed many pitches\nwith ice screw protection, usually belaying for 60 meters and climbing together\nfor another 40 or so. Distance is deceptive, and we kept saying things like\n&quot;looks like you get the gem of the final headwall!&quot; Three pitches later, the\nheadwall was still high above!</p>\n<p>Calves tiring, we once saw a man walking on the ridge crest above, peering\nimpassively down at us but not slowing. Why do we make more work for ourselves\nwith these variations? I&#39;d had enough, and after placing my last ice screw,\ngunned it for the top, gradually leaving blank ice for good steps in\nsnow. Wonderful to level out, able to stand up straight like a proper human and\nfeel the sun again too! Georg came up and we short-roped to the Valsorey summit.</p>\n<p>Georg is a collector of 4000 meter mountains, and here his fanaticism enabled\nhim to find another store of energy. He wanted to climb the distant Tssette\nsummit, and would need more than an hour to get there and back. He took off\nrunning down the slope, then back up to the true summit and beyond. I contented\nmyself with a slow saunter to the true summit. Frankly I couldn&#39;t move any\nfaster. Somehow the altitude was really affecting me. On top, I saw no sign of\nGeorg, but I knew he should be safely motoring between snowy summits to the\neast. I took some photos, then went back to the Valsorey summit, moving our\npacks to south side rock and settling in for a short nap.</p>\n<p>Georg returned and we started down the unknown rock ridge. Wow, it sets a record\nfor looseness! Horizontal quartize ledges covered with shards of disappointment\nthat get restacked after any fresh breeze, and that for over 1000 meters. We\nrappelled when it seemed appropriate, sometimes downclimbed carefully, sometimes\njumped into piles of sand and scree and let them scoot us down more easily. It\nwas so long before the difficult ground was complete, but eventually we sat at\nthe hut again and ate some soup before the hike out.</p>\n<p>Back at the car, nearly dead on our feet, we exploded the contents onto the\nroad, firing up the gas stove for pasta and staring glassy-eyed at catapillars\ncrawling across our sleeping bags. Slurping noodles contentedly in the darkness,\nwe were only surprised twice by a car roaring around the corner, sending us\nscattering out of the street boots in one hand, hot pot in the other. Amazing\nthat we didn&#39;t think to actually quit the road, but it was all we had and we\nweren&#39;t strong on making decisions at that point. At least we slept on the\nshoulder, my snores sending Georg across the street as I won the game of falling\nasleep first!</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-chamonix\">Back to Chamonix</h2>\n<p>Morning was wonderful, and we knew what we were going to do: back to Chamonix\nfor the Diable Ridge on the Mont Blanc du Tacul...nothing would stop us! In the\nprevious days, Georg had alternated between expressing a strong wish for the\nclimb, and with puppy-dog eyes, intimating that somehow it would never happen\ndue to cruel fate, dealing casual hands of weather veto, insufficiently\ncommitted partners, etc. By gorry, not on my watch! Let&#39;s go, dammit.</p>\n<p>Clutching new piles of food, we stuffed our sacks in the broiling Aiguille du\nMidi parking lot. This time we had rock shoes for the difficult rock we expected\nand what confidence that breeds! I started arguing irreverently to take less\ncams, not more. Less, less, less. Keep it light! But suitably chastened from the\nAiguille Verte, I had my bivy equipment of a down jacket and a (too large) bivy\nsack.</p>\n<p>On the Aiguille du Midi we waited an hour for the Hellbroner lift, chatting with\nsome American climbers about the Cascades, which I miss. Ah...to head into the\nPickets again! One day.</p>\n<p>The Torino Hut is a strange place, like a military institution. Climbers are\nassigned to steel bunks in white rooms with green doors aligned at right angles\nin gray hallways. All services are by queue, and you should get in line early\nbecause the soup dispensation has more calories at first as the servers &quot;dig\ndown&quot; for vegetables. Stony-faced guard women I remember from my childhood in\nHuntsville were serving. It really had the atmosphere of TDC (Texas Department\nof Corrections). Smiles among this set passed over the heads of climbers only to\nother personnel, and I munched my bread, feeling ever smaller, ever more\n&quot;institutionalized.&quot; Georg said &quot;I feel the spirit of this place is one of\ncompetition, not cooperation, like other huts.&quot;</p>\n<p>Oh well, at least it was fairly cheap, especially compared to the Cosmique\nHut. The fact that they had alpine club discounts was a redeeming feature. And\nthe intake warden was kind, if sardonic, along with a Chinese lady who got me\nsome tea.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mont-blanc-du-tacul-diable-ridge-d-v-\">Mont Blanc du Tacul, Diable Ridge (D+, V)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/3808873902/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3586/3808873902_1df0d0a654_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The Diable!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875843190/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8427/7875843190_83b6456f26_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg on the summit of Pt.

We saw lights climbing the wall above us to\nthe Diable Ridge. We hoped we could get up there without getting brained by\nfalling rocks. As if in answer, a couple came down to us. &quot;It is too warm, much\ntoo warm! We go down. The water is flying down the couloir.&quot; Whoa, sounds lame!</p>\n<p>But we thought we&#39;d have a look. I was pleasantly surprised with the transition\nfrom the ice to the rock, which was easy with a couple of ice screws to protect\nit. We had a bead on the traversing line to follow, with 2 climbers just ahead\nof us and some headlamps visible in the distance. We climbed easily, and reached\nthe great couloir coming down from the east side of the towers. Other climbers\ndecided to just go up here instead of traversing further right and then back\nleft as our guidebook had mentioned. Why not? There was good ice to climb, and\ndecent opportunities to protect the ascent via rock on the side of the\ncouloir. We followed this course too, placing pro and belaying a bit more than\nothers, who then went ahead. After several pitches it grew light, and another 30\nminutes of effort allowed us to reach the top of the couloir.</p>\n<p>We were happy about this, because just getting to this point worried us quite a\nbit. Now we would be doing rock climbing, in rock shoes no less, and this\nworried us less.</p>\n<p>We joined two parties at the Breche, and Georg led up the Diable tower in one\nnice pitch of cold grade III+. An abseil, then I was leading up the sunnier wall\nof the Point Chaubert, via a thin crack. I was a bit scared here with the heavy\npack and some hard moves ahead. I rested on a piton, then placed a cam in the\ncrack and rested on that experimentally. Then I committed to the moves, a burst\nof powerful liebacks transitioning to hand and foot jams. I stepped outside of\nmyself to see each hand and foot lock into place until I could breathe again and\nstand still, face pressed against the rock. A few more moves and I could protect\nthe rope with a cam in a good crack. We had 30 meters of rope, and I needed to\nstop below the summit, riding a wave of granite a chavel. Georg came up and made\nenjoyable moves to the top. Now we were truly in the highest, most unique\ncragging environment in the Alps. Looking over to Point Median, two parties were\nalready dealing with the 4 pitch route to the top, with another party creeping\nthrough the Breche beneath to get in position. Another party was rappelling into\nthe notch below the next tower. We had the feeling of security you get at a\ncragging area in settled weather, with plenty of folks around. Deceptive, but\nhelpful anyway!</p>\n<p>After the rappels, and a transition to the next wall, Georg was leading up the\nPoint Median. He climbed a steep crack, huge pack threatening to unbalance him,\nbut it&#39;s not so easy to knock him off his game. From a hanging belay he brought\nme up the crack and distinctive traverse that make this pitch a delight. I set\noff for another crack directly above, stopping to take pictures of the wild\nenvironment, and raving about the warm, secure hand-jams. The next pitch led up\na steep, snowy wall then traversed an exposed Diedre to a belay. An easy pitch\nwith an awkward bouldering move climbed through a window to the top.</p>\n<p>We make a steep and rather unnerving rappel here, chosing not to touch the very\ntop of this tower (&quot;contrived&quot; is my excuse). Two Germans, Jochen and Constantin\nwere just ahead of us all day, and we struck up short conversations along the\nway. Here we tried awkwardly to pass, but it just wasn&#39;t possible and was\ncomplicating things. They went on ahead while we occupied ourselves trying to\ntouch the absolute top of this tower (&quot;not contrived&quot; was my\njustification). Georg went up and did it, leaving a sling to protect the\ndownclimb. I swaggered that I would retrieve the sling and do the downclimb\nunprotected, but I quailed once I was up there, taking a picture, then feeling\ngrateful for the sling to protect my trip back down!</p>\n<p>A couple of rappels got us to the base of the last tower, l&#39;Isolee. I led off up\nand around a corner for some entertaining crack climbing (V) and passed two\nledges to a belay. We were able to leave our packs at the base which made\neverything so easy! Georg brought us to the summit where we admired the view for\na few minutes in the sun. What a great day and a great climb!!</p>\n<p>A steep rappel got us to our gear where we switched back to mountain boots, and\nset off in short-rope mode for the summit. Jochen and Constantin were around,\nand we scrambled together up relatively solid rock, searching for the easiest\nway. We popped over a ridge into a much snowier world, and there the true summit\nwas before us, all whipped cream and glazed ice with an ocean of glaciers\nbeneath. We roped up as one team for safety, and walked slowly to the top. A\nminute later, we were heading down steep chimneys to broad slopes of snow. 600\nmeters of descent down the famous glacier with a deep trough (used by folks\nclimbing Mont Blanc from the Cosmique Hut), then we stood on the flat plateau\nbelow the mountain. A long, slow walk up to the Cosmique Hut followed, in which\nI became so tired and bored! Georg took a picture of me in the front of the rope\nand named it &quot;the Tired Man,&quot; which was true.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cosmique-arete-dessert\">Cosmique Arete Dessert</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/13635014003/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5206/13635014003_3d6f2879c3_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael at the top of the Cosmique Arete</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875908812/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8433/7875908812_2ea81bec60_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael and highly interested spectators belay Georg.</em></p>\n<p>We had done it, the Diable! We were very happy, but pretty exhausted\ntoo. Nonetheless, in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand the idea of the boring walk\nup to the Aiguille du Midi lift station, so I proposed climbing the Cosmique\nArete. I&#39;d done it once, but Georg hadn&#39;t climbed it yet. He was always ready to\nclimb, so we hiked over there and dispatched the route fairly quickly, only\ntaking a bit longer because of a wrong turn onto some steep, rotten rock. We got\nback on track and I had the pleasure of reaching the top and marching to the\nladder and onto the tourist platform first. Folks gave me some room and I\nbrought Georg up with a hip belay and a body belay on the platform wall. Truly,\nthe view these folks had of the last meters of the climb was amazing. I was\nthinking, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s every bit as amazing as it looks,&quot; but perhaps I\nmisinterpreted their gaze...perhaps they thought it was a horrible, insane\nendeavor to do what we were doing. A nice girl, Naike, emailed me some of her\nphotos later.</p>\n<p>Back down to the Belvedere, and an unsettling confrontation over jars of Magnesium crystals. But I&#39;ve already related that. The important thing is what can we do next? The weather is becoming unsettled...</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-alphubel\">The Alphubel</h2>\n<p>Munching a late lunch of eggs, bread and oil, orange juice and pasta, we worked\nout the logistics for a climb of the Frontier Ridge to Mount Maudit. We&#39;d sleep\nin the Fourche bivouac hut, avoiding the need to stay in the oppressive Torino\nHut. This would give us a chance to scope out the route, which we&#39;d fallen in\nlove with since looking across at it from the Diable towers. It looked\nmagnificent, especially since I&#39;d never seen the shape of the line before, I\nonly knew that it was popular.</p>\n<p>But as we munched and talked, the weather was changing. We finally accepted that\nwe could still do the route as long as the Wednesday bad weather wasn&#39;t going to\narrive until somewhere after 10 am...we needed good weather from 3 am to 9 am at\na minimum. Who cares if we come down the easy way in a snowstorm, we thought.</p>\n<p>But the forecast lurched again that afternoon, such that snow would arrive at 4\nam Wednesday. Ugh. Okay, that plan is off. No amount of wishful thinking could\njustify any kind of ascent. So we looked east. At first we got excited about the\nBernese Alps, which we&#39;d never visited. The Schreckhorn looms large in our minds\nas a climb to do. But the weather fell apart there too, even worse than in\nChamonix. Only the Valais offered hope.</p>\n<p>With a gleam in his eye, Georg mentioned the Taeschhorn-Dom traverse, in fact a\nbigger thing, continuing on for the Lenzspitze and Nadelhorn too! We&#39;d have to\nbring gear for an open bivy on the glacier after the Dom. &quot;Why not?&quot; I\nsaid. &quot;You&#39;ll only keep badgering me about it until we do it so let&#39;s do it!&quot;\nHa. Not really. But I have to tease because I was not that enthusiastic about\ncarrying a full bivy kit over all those ridges. Almost since the beginning of my\nclimbing career, I&#39;ve done my best to stay away from heavy packs. But sometimes\nit&#39;s unavoidable. So let&#39;s go!</p>\n<p>The next morning we were in Saas Fee, slowly getting gear together and taking\nthe lifts up to the Mittal Allalin Station, above 3000 meters. We emerged into a\nworld of bulldozers and beeping construction equipment. &quot;Ugh,&quot; I thought. Georg\nagreed, it was an uninspiring place. We hastened away on the standard way up the\nAllalinhorn, then branched off it to scramble the rocky Feekopf. From there, we\ndropped onto a glacier and went up the easy (even boring) Alphubel. Our goal was\na bivouac hut at the Mischabeljoch below the North Ridge of the Alphubel. On top\nof the Alphubel, Georg felt a little sick, and wondered why. I had an idea...he\nlistened to me too well when I complained about heavy packs, and stuffed too\nmuch heavy gear into his own. I had a rope, but he had all the protection,\nstovewear and cooked food. So his pack was damn heavy. We went down the tricky\nNorth Ridge, taking almost twice as long as guidebooks suggest. We re-arranged\npacks a bit in the Michabel Bivouac, giving me a more equitable share of the\nweight. We would see in the morning if Georg felt better. Actually I was feeling\npretty good (I wonder why!).</p>\n<p>The bivouac was very nice. It had a wood stove, plenty of snow and firewood,\nmaking it very warm. But our inexperience and uncertainty about the weather\nnearly cost us the ascent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-t-schhorn-dom-traverse-d-iii-\">The Täschhorn-Dom Traverse (D, III+)</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875940820/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8288/7875940820_1caec5ab31_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Halfway up the ridge</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875942466/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7133/7875942466_89d9fa9e43_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg and Michael on top</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875946210/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8290/7875946210_f835b645e3_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Careful downclimbing.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875947766/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8294/7875947766_5bd1bd3658_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Will it ever stop!</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875954422/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7261/7875954422_3cc8bb5990_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The wild Domjoch.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875962460/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8305/7875962460_7db0cf6359_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Georg on the Domgrat</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875965490/\"><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7119/7875965490_b573924614_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>The rock becomes solid and hard as iron.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/7875968292/\"><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8448/7875968292_0307615870_b.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Michael in a priviledged position.

We couldn&#39;t imagine climbing in this stuff. We\nthought bad weather may have arrived early. We went back to bed for an hour. We\nchecked again, and again the wind deterred us. This time we slept while others\ngot ready and left. Now it was 5:30 am, and we were thinking how to escape back\nto the ground most efficiently. Two guys gave us some advice before they left:\n&quot;probably it&#39;s just windy here at the joch, why not try it and see?&quot; Indeed,\nsome climbers were high on the South Ridge of the Taeschhorn directly\nabove...maybe we are just being ninnies?</p>\n<p>So we set out at 6 am. Boy were we embarrassed, because only 10 minutes above\nthe hut, the wind was fairly calm. We passed one party, then caught up to two\nvery entertaining women who had regaled us the night before in the hut about a\ntraverse of the Grandes Jorasses a few days before. Soon we were on the summit,\nhaving made up for our late start with an ascent done in half the usual\ntime. The conditions were amazingly good...we didn&#39;t need crampons at all, as\nall significant snow and cornices had disappeared from the ridge. The rock\nscrambling was quite pleasant. Really, this was an excellent climb!</p>\n<p>So we sat on the Taeschhorn summit with the two women, took pictures and\nconsidered...should we keep going or quit while we are ahead?</p>\n<p>We were a bit scared of the next section: descending the North Ridge of the\nTaeschhorn is reputably without belays, on slabby, downsloping rock, and\nremembering our descent of the North Ridge of the Alphubel the day before, we\nhad found that terrain unnerving. Plus, when we reach the bottom of the ridge at\nthe Domjoch, we are absolutely committed to climb up the South Ridge of the\nDom. We read that the rock on this ridge is &quot;dangerously loose,&quot; not like the\nSouth Ridge of the Taeschhorn.</p>\n<p>But on the other hand, if we make it, then the descent of the Dom should be very\neasy, and we can sleep anywhere with our bivy gear. One of the women even\nchecked the weather for us on her smartphone. She said we are good to go.</p>\n<p>Gulp. Okay...let&#39;s do it!</p>\n<p>Right away we set off before we could change our minds. Indeed, the descent of\nthe Taeschhorn was rather stressful.Georg set off in the lead, placing\noccasional gear on 20 meters of rope and I downclimbed behind him.  I became\nrather superstitious. It was working, and I didn&#39;t want to upset the balance so\nI asked him to keep leading as a block. He did, but I know going in front was\nexhausting because of the mental strain of making so many choices about which\nway to go and where to place gear. Also, the wind had picked up and we became\nquite cold. We were wearing all our clothes, and felt like &quot;Michellin Men&quot;\nmoving around in a cumbersome way, with gear jangling all over, with heavy packs\nand wind, and on icy, unforgiving slabs of rock. In general, there were many\nareas where a foothold couldn&#39;t be found, and you had to move hand over hand\ndown angled slabs with the toes of your boots resting on insignificant\nnubbins. Though Georg placed some gear for protection, we both knew that a\nsingle slip by either of us would be complete disaster. No mistakes\nallowed. This is why superstition became a viable mode of thought, I&#39;m afraid.</p>\n<p>As we neared the Domjoch, I finally took over, eventually putting on crampons as\nwe had to traverse slabs of ice on the northwest side at times. Cornices of snow\non the southeast side of the ridge were visibly rotting, and at one point I was\nwalking on snow and a massive cornice collapsed just inches from my crampon\npoints. I was walking to the side, aware of this danger, but still it was\nshocking to see this great mass of snow let go all at once, very silently at\nfirst, then creating a great rumbling noise as it swept the face below and\nfilled the air with countless shimmering blocks of rock and ice in it&#39;s\nwake. &quot;F*(kin A!&quot; I croaked, stumbling to the safety of the next solid gendarme\nwhich Georg was lashed to.</p>\n<p>Later Georg dealt with a tricky section of loose, stacked blocks, and had to\nignore the great cracks and rumbles as a cornice right behind me disintegrated\nover several minutes. Indeed, it was a lonely, insecure place we were\ntraversing. And when the ridge leveled out, our troubles weren&#39;t over. Some of\nthe trickiest climbing was on steep snow of the level crest, harrowed and incut\nby smooth slabs. Endless decision making: climb down and around, across or over\nthe top? Climb delicately onto the southwest side, risking rotten snow collapse?\nAt least if each climber is on the opposite side of the ridge, theoretically a\nfall can be stopped by the weight of one climber on the other side. Hmm.</p>\n<p>Gratefully, we mantled onto a rocky ledge slightly above the level of the\nDomjoch. It had taken us 3.5 hours, every minute nerve-wracking. The guidebook\nsaid it should take from 2 to 3 hours. So again we felt inadequate. &quot;Descending\nis our weakness,&quot; intoned Georg. I wanted to protest, but facts don&#39;t\nlie. Still, I couldn&#39;t imagine doing it any faster with any security...I felt I\nwas moving as fast as I could in that stuff.</p>\n<p>But it is done...now to climb back up to the Dom. We removed crampons and\nfollowed our noses over and around towers. Happily, many people have climbed in\ncrampons and scratch marks on the rock point the most likely way. It would be\nvery easy to go wrong in here. For example, once we started traversing to the\nright, by an easy ledge system that made it seem possible to avoid two\ntowers. That could save a lot of time. But if the ledges peter out, they&#39;ll\nleave you on a very loose and dangerous face, with the solid crest of the ridge\nhigh above you...maybe higher than it&#39;s possible for you to reach safely. Then\nyou have to go back, and how far back? In the morning we had wandered onto the\nSouth Face of the Taeschhorn by precisely this logic, and it was rather\nnerve-wracking to regain the crest. With the rock on the Dom so much worse, I\nknow I was pretty scared about losing the crest. &quot;Georg, let&#39;s stay on the top,\nI see the trail too, but I think it&#39;ll go wrong.&quot; Georg agreed, and though we\nmay have done more work than necessary climbing over towers, we later looked\ndown to where that ledge system led, and it didn&#39;t look...good. At all.</p>\n<p>Here we are in a real wilderness. Man&#39;s inner life, the hunches and feelings he\nhas, they become much more important in a real wilderness. The ability to pay\nattention to them is vital. When to protect, where to go up. Which footholds can\nyou trust, sticking out as they do from the horizontal bands of Gneiss. Is it a\nrock solidly attached, or only lightly frozen in place...immovable to the\ntesting hand, but quite different for the foot with 200 pounds bearing down on\nit? Thousands of decisions to make, seemingly unconscious, but certainly\nthere...taking a toll. As the towers become more narrow and spindly, as the\ndrops on either side more dramatic, you may feel something closing in.</p>\n<p>But we had assets too. Some food, some tea. The sun, and the right side of the\nridge offered shelter from the wind. We had the evidence of progress piling\nup. The summit grew closer, and we knew the rock should become more solid. We\nhad even seen this happening. The exhausting, icy North Ridge of the Taeschhorn\nreceded from our minds as well. Now maybe there is time to smile.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, it was a pitch of hard rock climbing that lifted my spirits. I\nstood below a vertical wall, having tested to find good initial holds. &quot;Georg,\nextend the rope all the way, I need 50 meters!&quot; I called. He did this. With two\ngood pieces of protection at the base of the wall, I felt good to continue up,\nstill testing everything carefully. The whole trip had made me strong for\nthis. I had the sun on my back. The time is now, the holds are good. A bit\nright, then back left. A turn to the side, fitting the left foot on a ledge, and\ncarefully stand up. Though I bonk my head on an overhang it doesn&#39;t matter with\nthe helmet...I chuckle. Soon I&#39;m on top, and with a real solid belay, and the\nwind has died! &quot;Come on up, Georg!&quot; I&#39;m back in my most comfortable identity: a\nrock climber on the crags, just belaying a friend on a nice, easy climb.</p>\n<p>This mental stance of security spread outward in two directions, up and down the\nridge...softening the memories of what we&#39;d come from, and paving the way with\nconfidence ahead. &quot;This is AMAZING!&quot; I said, and meant it. We swapped leads up\nmore towers, climbing out of holes in the ridge and the mind.</p>\n<p>Georg reached the summit, occupied by a gaggle of crows hiding in the lee of the\nwind. They fluttered away on my approach. Only a moment to smile and look\naround, to shake hands. There seemed to be faint flashes of heat lightening, so\nwe quickly geared up for the glacier descent. A last look back at the sinewy\nridge from the Taeschhorn, and the Alphubel behind, then it was obscured in\ncloud.</p>\n<p>Down, easily down, down. Then it was icy, and we faced in. We tried to angle for\nthe Lenzjoch, as a place to sleep. Maybe we should have followed the standard\nroute, but even though our way was tedious it was nothing compared to what we&#39;d\nbeen through. Kick, kick, hammer. The way flattened...&quot;this is the spot, let&#39;s\ncamp here.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Alright.&quot;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In the morning, we gamely tried to keep going. After a cold, somewhat\nuncomfortable night, we reached the Lenzjoch and climbed over a tower. We warmed\nup a bit in the weak morning sun, but the strong wind was exhausting me\nalready. Was I ready for another day of this? We knew it should be easier, but I\nwas suspicious about how much easier. I thought it might be almost as hard as\nthe day before, and I didn&#39;t want something almost as hard. Frankly, I was tired\nand felt I was losing my edge. Then, on descent from a tower I pulled the rope\ndown and the wind blew it far left into a blank cliff...save for a flake of rock\nthat caught the rope well and fast. Disgusted, I pulled and pulled, but it was\ncaught. At that moment I knew I was done. I didn&#39;t want to continue after this,\nomen or whatever it may be. We cut the rope, losing about 15 meters due to the\naccident.</p>\n<p>Georg was able to keep going, saying that he would be happy either way. So it\nwas up to me. I hated to be the guy to stop a trip early, but I realized that I\nhad run out of patience for the many unexpected things that can happen in a big\nclimbing day. Sure, if everything goes great, then no problem. But I&#39;ve climbed\nlong enough to know that such days are rare, and that you have to be ready for\nthe unexpected. I no longer met that requirement...I didn&#39;t want any more\nunexpected and would react to it poorly. So I was done. I called it, and led us\ndown a steep ice wall to a bergschrund. Georg found the way over the &#39;schrund,\nthen we walked easy glacier to the Festijoch. Here, some difficulties led to him\nclimbing down a loose horror-wall, and me rappelling from anchors on the\nstandard descent. After some hours, we made it to the Europa Hut for good lunch\nand beer. Another hour and a half and we were in Randa, having descended 10,000\nvertical feet since my decision on now aching knees. A train and bus got us back\nto Saas Fee as the rain started. With poor weather for the next days, we decided\nto head home.</p>\n<p>It was enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thank-you\">Thank you</h2>\n<p>Massive thanks to Georg, an unbelievably competent and steady partner, always\nwilling to do MORE than he should, always with a smile and a sense of humor even\nwhen such things left me behind.</p>\n"}
