{"date":"2007-10-7","title":"Fasul Valley Deathmarch","blurb":"with Josef","description":"<p>Josef and I wanted to go climbing, and supposedly had a decent forecast.\nI was eager to explore the Verwall Range, south of St. Anton, which is\na famous ski resort in Austria. I had naively picked out the Kuchen Spitze\nwhich has a Grade VI 20 pitch north face climb. Sounds awesome! In reality,\nthere are only a couple of grade VI pitches, mostly it&#39;s easier.</p>\n<p>But Josef pointed out how incredibly cold and snowy it would be. Still\ntrying to be ambitious, I proposed the mountain next door, Patteriol, via\nit&#39;s Grade IV northeast ridge. Okay, 25 pitches, but about half of them\nreally shouldn&#39;t be called &quot;pitches&quot; at all (just grade II scrambling).\nAll of this wrangling was rendered moot though when we drove into heavy\nrain falling in St. Anton!</p>\n<p>So we decided to go on a hike instead. I have a 50,000 scale map of the\narea, and I picked out a nice looking loop hike. It looked long and exciting.\nWe pulled all the climbing gear out of our packs. Then I forgot to bring\nthe sandwich I bought at a gas station.</p>\n<p>We drove up a road from St. Anton about 4 kilometers, then rode our bikes\nfrom the Verwall See to the Konstanzer Hut (1688 m). Man, biking up steep\nhills is HARD! At least it quit raining right when we started pedaling.</p>\n<p>We walked south along the Fasul River for several long miles, continually\nhoping the clouds would open up. Sometimes we&#39;d get a local view of golden\nheather slopes which were just beautiful. I griped about all my problems\nat work and Josef was a good sport for my ranting! None of this helped\nour motivation to put one foot in front of the other, but when we reached\nthe Schafbichljoch (2635 m) near the head of the valley we were happy we\nkept going. We&#39;d gained about 1100 meters of elevation at this point, and\nwere happy that now we could start heading back north on the other side\nof the mountains that make up the eastern half of the Fasul Valley.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704702728184946\"><img src=\"http://lh4.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlKzpw8JHI/AAAAAAAABNY/1EOwUSb7XUo/s288/coollake.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We followed a side trail past a pretty tarn below the Grauer Kopf. We&#39;d\nonly seen a few patches of snow to this elevation, but north and east sides\nproved to be much snowier. I was starting to feel like it would be a monster\nday by the time we got back to the bikes, so I declined Josef&#39;s idea of\ncontinuing on the crest to the Karkopf, climbing at least three peaks on\nthe way. So we split up with detailed plans for meeting again. I bombed\ndown through 2 feet of fresh snow to eventually reach trail again. I was\nnot really dressed for this! No gaitors, and old tennis shoes, which were\nin fact visibly falling apart! Oh well, my socks are warm. I got mysterious\ncloudy views from the Matnaljoch (2656 m), with big snowy peaks to the\nsouth.</p>\n<p>Down in a huge rocky basin I heard a hoot. Josef was standing on the crest\nfar above!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704797217465490\"><img src=\"http://lh6.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK5Jw8JJI/AAAAAAAABNo/iEmx6SZnLi4/s288/shouldigoon.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I took a picture and wished him well. Then I bent to my tiring task of\nclimbing about 300 meters up to a pass. As I neared the top, Josef called\nfrom below. He gave up on the crest ascent, because of sketchy, snowy,\nicy terrain, and an endless series of peaks to climb. At the pass by the\nKarkopf, we faced the sobering fact that we still had a long was to go\nto reach the Darmstaedter Hut, and then from there we&#39;d still have to climb\n400 meters and descend 1000 to reach the bikes. It was already almost 3\npm, after more than 6 hours of non-stop travel, and darkness would come\nby 7. We were also scheduled to cross two glaciers according to the map.\nI didn&#39;t take them all that seriously though...yet!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704835872171186\"><img src=\"http://lh3.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK7Zw8JLI/AAAAAAAABN8/PQeLOwP9PUY/s288/goodweather.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704848757073090\"><img src=\"http://lh6.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK8Jw8JMI/AAAAAAAABOE/-6rjRhUfZGI/s288/kuechelsp.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704857347007698\"><img src=\"http://lh4.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK8pw8JNI/AAAAAAAABOM/9Rn_H2VeYxA/s288/madleinalp.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Down into the broad valley below the Kuechel Spitze, first on deep and\nwet snow. Later, we lost the trail and spent an annoying hour climbing\nup and down without the trail to get back on track. Finally we saw it below\nus further south, and could downclimb a steep gully to reach it. It&#39;s hard\nto believe you can lose a trail in Austria...they are so well marked! (usually).</p>\n<p>Another 250 meter ascent to the Rautejoechle, this one taken very slow\nto conserve energy. Now we were in thick fog, after a long, cold day with\nonly occasional sunbreaks. We started down on rocks, then snow, then (gulp)\nreal glacier. We were stomping along when we saw an open crevasse on the\nright. Then on the left there was a kind of bergschrund below us...we&#39;d\nhave to guess where a snowbridge was thick enough to let us cross! Oddly\nenough, on the last bit of rock above the glacier, a spray-painted arrow\nordered us to go left, right into the bergschrund (or above it). But it\nlooked dangerous. So we went almost straight down, where the ice seemed\nnearest to rock.</p>\n<p>Now, in the fog, we had to guess which way to get to the Hut. Remembering\nthe arrow, we trended left. Suddenly, we noticed a long depression in the\nsnow just below us, going about 100 feet in both directions. We were on\nthe glacier at one of the worst possible times: when fresh snow covers\nthe crevasses. In winter and spring, they would be so thick there are no\nworries. In summer and early fall they are completely open and easy to\navoid. We moved around it, then very carefully crossed. Josef&#39;s foot went\ntoo deep in one place, and I didn&#39;t like the hint of darkness I saw beneath.\nWe continued finding these depressions and crabbing carefully across several\nmore times, aiming for an area of the glacier covered by rocks, and breathing\na big sigh of relief when we got there!</p>\n<p>This really impacted our thoughts for crossing the second glacier going\nup to the Kuchenjoch pass. Darkness, fog, deceptively covered crevasses...what\na horrible combination for tired hikers with no equipment other than their\nwits! We started to think about staying overnight at the Darmstaedter Hut\nif there was an open winter room.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704891706746098\"><img src=\"http://lh4.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK-pw8JPI/AAAAAAAABOc/hoS-NZlmGYY/s288/darmstaedter.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>After a longish, tiring descent we reached the hut at 2384 meters. The\nfog had lifted a bit and we had some local mountain views. Josef found\nthat the winter room was open, with plenty of blankets, pillows. Also a\npropane stove!</p>\n<p>Already we sorely missed my sandwich left in the car. Josef had to start\nsplitting his food with me. At the hut we talked a few minutes about pressing\non, but it was far enough after 6 pm, that we thought we&#39;d be up on the\nglacier in darkness. No need to pile a 4th danger onto the ones we&#39;d already\nsigned up for, so we gathered water from a creek and set to enjoying our\nstove. We called Daniel, Kris and Angie. Daniel because he and I were hoping\nto do a hike or climb the next day. Darn, no chance now! He told us we\nshould have great weather the next day.</p>\n<p>The alpine club asks for a 9 euro donation per person to stay in the hut.\nIt was pretty wonderful. It got very cold outside once the sun went down,\nbut we were quite cozy. My socks were soaking wet, and I made a major campaign\nof getting them dried by morning, with a combination of hanging over the\nstove, wrapping them around a hot water bottle at night, and finally putting\nthem on my feet when still damp to get some drying action from my body\nheat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704900296680706\"><img src=\"http://lh6.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlK_Jw8JQI/AAAAAAAABOk/SU7X6KVZaws/s288/kuchennight.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Josef gave me a 2-square-inch 1/2 sandwich for dinner. I organized the\nevening activities. Tea at 7, photo viewings at 7:30, dinner at 8:00, more\ntea, then bed at 9:00. And when I say &quot;tea&quot; I mean hot water with a little\nbit of salt in it. I was kind of amazed at how good we felt despite running\non very little food all day. As long as we didn&#39;t think about a big dinner,\nwe were okay!</p>\n<p>After studying the map some more, and talking of other things, we went\nto bed. Josef had to stay up until 10 to call Angie, but I was already\nasleep then. All the hot water hydrated me pretty well, so I had to get\nup twice to take a leak. The promised good weather finally arrived in the\nnight, with clear black skies, twinkling with stars. I shivered so violently\nwhen I went out that the stars were shaking!</p>\n<p>Morning came, and after some hot water, salt, two tiny squares of chocolate\nand a 1/2 apple we were on our way. Josef additionally ate his two cherry\ntomatoes, but I saved mine for our high point, 400 meters above.</p>\n<p>We enjoyed the great views, especially of the snowy glacier we came down,\nand the imposing north face of the Kuchen Spitze...home of the long Grade\nVI climb I had raved about. It did look snowy and cold!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118704964721190226\"><img src=\"http://lh5.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlLC5w8JVI/AAAAAAAABPM/nK2cpK2v66k/s288/tokuchenjch.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Eventually we realized that if there was once a glacier on part of this\ntrail, it was gone now. Josef saw evidence of a trail re-route further\nup the slope, though it was hardly necessary. &quot;We could have come up this\nin the dark,&quot; he said. Yep it&#39;s true, but we didn&#39;t know that then. At\nleast now we got to enjoy the scenery. After a short &quot;via ferrata&quot; section\non a cliff, we reached the pass to be blown away by an &quot;in your face&quot; view\nof the northeast ridge of Patteriol. It looked wonderful. Indeed, if we\nhad started fresh today we could have done it, because there was very little\nsnow for some reason (contrast with the Kuchen Spitze). A long, 25 pitch\nrock climb, it reminded me a bit of Mount Goode in Washington. The peak\ndominates all others in a wide radius.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch/photo#5118705020555765122\"><img src=\"http://lh6.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlLGJw8JYI/AAAAAAAABPk/oMrXwUJrBr0/s288/patteriol1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We can&#39;t wait to climb it next summer then!</p>\n<p>A long and beautiful hike down alpine slopes followed. I tried to prolong\nthe enjoyable feeling by stopping a few minutes by a babbling brook and\nscanning the countryside for more hikes. The Alps are so huge! And the\nvast slopes above timberline just invite wandering. In a little more than\nan hour we&#39;d made the 1000 meter descent to the bikes. Here we were shocked\nto see people for the first time! A gentleman farmer sweeping his barn,\nand two kids who rode their bikes up to the Hut.</p>\n<p>We sped down the road, reaching the car after 20 minutes. A good lunch\nin St. Anton, and we headed home. Thanks to Josef for being game for such\nan &quot;underspecified&quot; adventure, and for sharing half his food!</p>\n<p>I think we should name this hike the &quot;Fasul Deathmarch&quot;. The elevation\ngain and loss, is over 2500 meters. Kilometers? Who knows...many!</p>\n<p>If we&#39;d had more daylight, or known that the glacier below the Kuchenjoch\nis non-existent, then we could have finished it in a day. But it worked\nout great and we saw some amazing new country.</p>\n<p>More pictures here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch\"><img src=\"http://lh4.google.com/ripsawridge/RwlKy5w8JGE/AAAAAAAABP4/gJP9WM6ooW0/s160-c/FasulValleyDeathmarch.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/ripsawridge/FasulValleyDeathmarch\">Fasul Valley Deathmarch</a></p>\n"}
