I thought about several\noptions, but finally resolved to tick off the West Ridge of the North\nTwin Sister.  This route is well-known for firm, grippy rock, and\nprovides a wonderful scrambling experience &quot;hard to equal in it&#39;s\ngrade.&quot;  I&#39;d always canceled plans to go there because of the long\nlogging roads that have to be hiked or biked for 3000 feet of\nelevation gain just to get there.  I&#39;ve really got to make my peace\nwith these logging roads...but I can&#39;t <em>I just can&#39;t!</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"images/bakertwin.jpg\" alt=\"Mt. Baker from the summit is a beautiful sight, huh?\"></p>\n<p>I took a bike, pushing it most of the way. I was somewhat worried\nabout this approach, having heard various horror stories about getting\nlost. I left the car at 7:15 am and went up the road, taking the 4th\nright as instructed. This comes at about 2.5 miles. The overgrown road\nhad a tank trap at less than half a mile, then continued gently (I\ncould actually ride this road) to cross a creek and enter a world of\nforest industry. I heard dump trucks and heavy machinery behind the\ntrees. My instructions were to turn left on an abandoned road with a\ndead tree across it. Well, I saw a road with a dead tree beside it,\nand thought that was good enough. 20 minutes later, having crawled up\nand down 2 dozen tank traps, and abandoned the bike in some bushes, I\nrealized that this road was taking me away from the mountain. I went\nback down, where a friendly worker told me that all the roads were\ndestroyed like that. He said there were other roads I could try\ntaking, but didn&#39;t know exactly which one would reach the west\nridge. Luckily enough, right before having to somehow ride around an\nearth moving machine busily moving earth, I found the road with the\ntree across it. Also a little cairn. &quot;Only climbers make cairns,&quot; I\nreasoned.</p>\n<p>This road was pretty steep, and after several switchbacks I made it\nto the end (ignoring any turn offs, I believe there were two). A\ntent was here, but no people. The west ridge was in perfect view.\nIt took 2.5 hours to get here, including my wrong turn.</p>\n<p>An obvious trail goes up the ridge, into pleasant timber, and out to scrub\ntrees and boulders with a great view of the rest of the route. Trying\nto ignore the sounds of industry behind me, I started up. First I dutifully\nfollowed the cairns that marked little dirt paths between rocky steps.\nBut eventually I learned that this would severely limit the enjoyable\nscrambling! &quot;&#39;nuff of that,&quot; I remarked to a pale green\nsphere hovering nearby. The rough solid rock provided many handholds, and I\nsought to maximize the angle with traverses and walls. On or just below\nthe crest was best. I met another party midway up, they had the tent\ndown at the start of the trail. It wasn&#39;t worthwhile to read the route\ndescription, as even the steepest sections of rock had cracks\nto allow progress. My favorite was a few lieback moves to an exposed\nstep-across, to a mantle supported by a finger crack, then a hand\ncrack! It was all lichen-encrusted so I dubbed it a first ascent.\n&quot;The Green Orb&quot; Grade 0.0032, 5.7. Behind me, the floating enigma\nchuckled. </p>\n<p>The ridge leveled out before the summit, and I climbed a few sub-summits\nbefore getting to the real thing. Mt. Baker was so &quot;in my face,&quot; so\n&quot;extreme.&quot; Especially the Black Buttes. I mentally drew lines snaking \nup their buttresses and wondered what it would be like on them. A few\nminutes of relaxation, and I was eager to get down. I especially looked\nforward to the bike ride! </p>\n<p>Foolishly, I decided to go down the north face. I chose the lowest angle\nsection, and descended left of a steep neve field. The rock was terrible,\nand every move dislodged a battery of charges. Finally I could scree-ski\nfor short distances. I reached the top of a cliff and found a way down\ntraversing to the right. More scree below this led me to a snowfield\nand a trickling stream with heavenly water. I had done the whole trip\non one quart of Gatorade, mistakenly assuming I would find somewhere to\nrefill it. But the only streams up till now had oily muck from the\nnearby road and industrial machinery. So this was good.</p>\n<p>I climbed down another cliff, then began a long traverse back to the\nWest ridge, sometimes on slippery heather. Once I slipped into a\nhuckleberry patch. Rather than get up, I immediately fell to eating\nthe ripe berries that seemed to drop from the limbs. The green orb and\nI sought out the best patches, oblivious to observers friend or foe.\nResuming the descent, I quickly found the trail and hiked down\nto the trailhead camp. It was 1:45 pm. As you can guess, the bike ride\nwas fast, and would have been faster if I were a better biker.\nI reached the car at 2:30, and drove back to various obligations.\nLater, near the town of Acme, I saw a great view of the Sisters Range\nthat had been hidden in the morning. A small green speck seemed to\nhover near the ascent ridge.</p>\n<p>In later years I was often asked about my vision that October day\non the West Ridge. Despite publication of a book of verse on the subject\n(now out of print), I never really came to grips with the phenomenon,\nthough I always felt the presence to be a friendly one (witness the\nhuckleberry incident, which I still recall warmly).</p>\n"}
