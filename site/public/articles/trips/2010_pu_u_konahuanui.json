We had a great time hiking\nup and talking about things. Climbing was a huge topic, as he&#39;s getting\ninto that in college in Boulder. Alex also explained a lot to me about\nrare plants and how they get protected in the islands, particularly on\narmy land. For example, an area with wild rare plants to be protected will\noften be fenced, because wild pigs root up everything. There is a crew\nof local guys who put in the fencing, which is often in remote wilderness,\non steep and dangerous terrain. A job benefit is that they get to hunt\nall the pigs left inside the fenced area. Pig hunters in Hawai&#39;i have so\nmany interesting stories.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288120489/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5044/5288120489_e5e274d49b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288724330/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5166/5288724330_c09c2b8ccd.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288123151/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5288123151_eabd8c4a53.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288727068/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5288727068_5bf9274196.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288125261/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5288125261_de61c8ccfe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288126357/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5006/5288126357_ea3be56d34.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288127011/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5048/5288127011_10e0ed786d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Amazingly, we made it to the summit before the usual clouds drifted in,\nalthough the view northeast was usually obscured by a cloud, and as we\nhung out up there, traversing the ridge to the main summit, the cloud kept\ntrying to spill over to the south side of the ridge. From the main summit\nwe could look steeply down to the Pali lookout, and across to Kaneohe and\nmore Ko&#39;olau Range peaks. What a cool place!</p>\n<p>I resolved to get some cleated shoes like Alex, they seem custom made\nfor these slippery slopes. My tennis shoes were utterly devoid of tread,\nso I pretty much wallowed in the mud on the ridge and part of the way down.\nWhew, was I dirty! &quot;Be one with the dirt,&quot; Alex said, or something similar!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288132597/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5288132597_513e4a1197.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288133597/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5125/5288133597_256c2da4f0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288737602/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5288737602_36de11db23.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288739990/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5288739990_86c21a947b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/5288139357/\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5209/5288139357_bc7567c6e2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Anyway it was great to meet Alex, and get some ideas for future trips.\nI&#39;ve got 2-3 steep ridges to climb next time around.
