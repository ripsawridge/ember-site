{"date":"2012-6-16","title":"Herzschlag der Leidenschaft (VI+/A0)","description":"<p>Also posted on cascadeclimbers.com <a href=\"http://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1072660\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Hi all, some of youse may remember me from the old days! I try to come around when I know of something interesting for yall, and I think I have something. If not this particular climb then recognize that there are a dozen like it.</p>\n<p>&quot;Herzschlag der Leidenschaft&quot; is a massive &quot;sport alpine&quot; climb, rated at 5.12a if you do it all free. \nFor mortals like me, it goes at solid 5.10 with A0. The coolest thing is the length: 32 bitchin&#39; pitches! \nThe vertical gain is 1200 meters, and the climbing length is 1700 meters, thanks to some long traverses\nmid-height.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7098/7393528814_c264553444.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I was thinking of it as a bigger cousin to Mt. Garfield&#39;s big sport climb. The lower 16 pitches \nare &quot;approach,&quot; and the real hairy stuff is in the upper half. </p>\n<p>Fitted out like lycra-clad sport climbers, we weren&#39;t ready for the truly hairy moat to start things off. \nHere I am carving pitiful steps with rocks, weeping about the 60 foot drop into blackness just right of my\ntender tennis-shoed feet:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8141/7389345156_cfd6bd01b0.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>But finally we started. I&#39;m old, and barely skilled, so I got the loose crappy block. \nBut there were 3-4 excellent pitches and some always satisfying simul-climbing in coils like you see in\nold films.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5340/7389351990_6f500b5677.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8019/7389355238_7c90d23b89.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>But for young turks, the fun begins with a 5.10c rightward traverse:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7084/7389358028_74dd123611.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>then a 4 pitch leftward traverse! Barely gaining elevation! Check out the ominous &quot;bivouac holes&quot;\nabove my buddy Georg&#39;s head.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7239/7389363846_805cf8f8a0.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Oh yeah. We&#39;re in Austria...here is what the countryside looks like from mid-height:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5343/7389367588_1a3de855aa.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Here the climbing is so exposed and very good:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7095/7389392354_89bb204e10.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We go straight up beyond Georg:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8020/7389388968_265436acc4.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Yeah, I&#39;m in A0 land for a while!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5337/7389395908_ec424fcace.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>I redeem myself with some scrappy 5.8 pitches, where the bolts ran out and I used all our cams\nin the chimney above my head. Higher, you can see an amazing lieback crack (5.11a/b) that we don&#39;t have \npictures of.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7225/7389398840_d3e77d6f77.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>A bit more short roping, to reach the upper headwall and the last 3 pitches:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7092/7389413658_d358af427b.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>On the way down we can see the wall, moving like a ghost ship through the green sea:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5159/7389436840_493cbe556b.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>We walked right into a restaurant below the wall. Characteristically American, I order the fries:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8152/7389447276_f03b10d040.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Anyway, there do seem to be at least 10 routes like this with more than 30 pitches in the area. One of them, \n&quot;Ende Nie&quot; (Never-ending) is 38 pitches, rated 5.10b. Sure, there is some loose stuff along the way, but\nthe ratios are pretty good. For this one, I added up 630 meters of 3rd/4th class, 600 meters of mid-5th,\nand 470 meters of 5.10a and above. Mebbe you guys want to come out this way. Austria seems to be\ncompletely ignored as a climbing destination. I never saw an American over here! Something to do for\nOktoberfest anyway.</p>\n<p>So that is the news from here. Take care and have a great summer cc.com!</p>\n<h3 id=\"gear-notes-\">Gear Notes:</h3>\n<p>Double 60 meter ropes, 12 quickdraws, 4-5 cams and 6 nuts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"approach-notes-\">Approach Notes:</h3>\n<p>Literally 5 minutes from the car. The descent is a hiking trail down (about two hours)</p>\n"}
