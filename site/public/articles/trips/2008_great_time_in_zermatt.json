We stayed in the Haus Ascott, had a nice apartment\nwhere, shocked by the high prices in Switzerland, we resolved to cook every\nmeal. This turned out to be one of the most fun things. Kris invented a\ndish with chicken wrapped in bacon. Mmm. Lots of red peppers and onions\ntoo. Man it was good. Had many adventures with the boys, including a long\nhike down a mountain (&#39;bout 500 feet elevation descent, not too shabby\nfor 3 year olds I think).</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a Flickr slideshow <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157605748481978/show/\">here</a>.\nKris will also have pictures, and I&#39;ll add the link soon.</p>\n"}
