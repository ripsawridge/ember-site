{"date":"2006-8-10","title":"Grossglockner attempt","blurb":"woefully unprepared","description":"<p>Saturday Mat and I left Garmisch hoping to do an alpine climb. But the Engadin\nvalley, our hopeful destination, was wrapped in clouds. Mat was keen on climbing\nthe Grossglockner, so we figured we could first do some sport climbing in Zirl,\nthen drive down there in the evening.</p>\n<p>First the sport climbing was really fun. We did a route with 4 short pitches of\n5+, 6, 5, 5. Mat led the first two pitches as one, then I led the second set. We\nrapped the route. Next door was a harder route with pitches of 7-,5+,7,5. Mat\nled the 7 pitches, both of which had cruxes too hard for me, so I had to pull on\nquickdraws and hang liberally. I led the easier pitches, the first of which was\npretty run out. This time we walked down. I brought my camera but forgot the\nmemory card, so there are no pictures of this trip. Alas!</p>\n<p>Later after a pizza dinner we drove to the Franz Josef Hoehe and bedded down for\nthe night at 1 am. Our alarm was set for 3 am! We were hiking a bit before 3:30,\nand making for the Pavacinni Couloir. After a long walk up the glacier in\ncrampons, Mat thought he saw where we should turn up to gain the bivy shelter\nnear the base of the route. But on the map it showed complete glacier coverage,\nwhile in the pre-dawn darkness it was clear there was no glacier. I thought it\nmust be the next rock outcrop where we turn up, which had a big white glacier in\nfront of it.</p>\n<p>Once on the side glacier we were climbing fairly steeply up ice slopes. It had\nbeen more than a year since I&#39;d been on such slopes, and it was hard to get used\nto again. Finally we were front-pointing and using two axes. My floppy boots and\nold style crampons were proving to be no match for this terrain. While following\nMat up an ice gully a crampon slipped and I was caught by my tools. This was\ncreepy. We got up to a flatter area and I tightened my boots and crampons which\nI really needed to do. I didn&#39;t expect such icy uncompromising terrain, and\nworried a little about the big couloir we hadn&#39;t even gotten close to yet.</p>\n<p>It got lighter and we came to a wall of ice. I told Mat I needed a belay on these walls, due to not trusting my boots at all. I was disappointed to need to rope up (and thus travel more slowly) with so much terrain still ahead of us, but without complete faith in your equipment and ability on icy terrain progress will grind to a halt anyway. Mat led out and then I followed the pitch on belay, really glad I&#39;d asked for it.</p>\n<p>It got lighter and we climbed several more little ice walls, along with some\neasier weaving in and out of crevasses. This glacier was steeper and more\ndifficult than we expected! A memorable pitch was sticking crampon points into\none wall of a crevasse and putting hands or back on the other wall. I also\nenjoyed using the ice as handholds sometimes, a recommendation I remember\nreading in the Chouinard Climbing Ice book. It really did speed things up.</p>\n<p>Finally we were on the upper flat part of the glacier, but still in a maze of\ncrevasses. We saw the fabled couloir far to our left, and gradually realized\nwe&#39;d climbed the wrong glacier! We did go one glacier too far. Getting back to\nwhere we needed to be would be very difficult. Plus, it was raining pretty\nsteadily, the upper mountain was sheathed in cloud, and the couloir promised to\nbe bare rock at it&#39;s base and time-consuming ice above. With my boot situation,\nI knew I wasn&#39;t properly equipped for the climb. As the rain increased, we\ndecided to go down.</p>\n<p>Descending steep ice takes a lot of time! I went in front, then when we reached\nthe ice walls, Mat put in an ice screw and belayed me down. I&#39;d place a screw\nand belay him down, or sometimes he&#39;d just come down casually. For me, the\nfront-pointing down climbing was a lot of work because I was really tense. I\nnever had to front point down so much hard steep ice. Actually, it was great\npractice and I&#39;m glad we got to do it. Still, the lower section of steep\nflat-footing and more front pointing without a belay took a lot out of me.</p>\n<p>Mat hiked up to the head of the glacier and I followed until I got hungry and\nwanted some warm gloves, hiking back to sit on my pack and look at the\nmountains. After walking down a ways we completely confirmed our mistake and\nidentified the correct way to go for the next attempt.</p>\n<p>The 300 meter hike back up to Franz Josef Hoehe seemed to take me forever. Mat was waiting, seemingly ready to climb something else!</p>\n<p>On the long drive back to Garmisch we had constant sun, as this land was well\nprotected by a Foehn wind. I took a nap at Mat&#39;s house, then we had some coffee\nand exchanged stories. Thanks to Mat for a great trip - good lessons and\npractice were learned on a steep glacier, probably rarely visited by the sane!\n&quot;We need to get stronger,&quot; Mat said diplomatically. I am really out of shape\nthis year!</p>\n"}
