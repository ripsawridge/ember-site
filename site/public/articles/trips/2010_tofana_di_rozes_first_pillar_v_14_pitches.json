{"date":"2010-8-5","title":"Tofana, First Pillar (V+)","blurb":"with Jesse","description":"<p>The morning after our <a href=\"totenkirchl.html\">big adventure in the Wilder Kaiser</a> we\nwere tired and dehydrated. It looked like the day would be another scorcher\nin Austria so we decided to abandon plans of another big climb there and\nhead on down to the Dolomites. A rest day was essential! We hiked down\nto the car, then took a bath in the freezing cold Kaisertalbach. I only\ndid it because Jesse did. Painful...but eventually quite refreshing. On\nthe way down to Cortina we hydrated and got a pizza lunch in a deserted\nBressanone. Gelato too, of course.</p>\n<p>In Cortina we found a pension on the road heading north, about 10 minutes\nwalk from downtown. I think it was 30 euros a night. During our stay we\npiggybacked wifi off some neighbors. This was extremely handy as we tried\nto figure out some rather unsettled weather. It was raining when we arrived.</p>\n<p>On the whole, our weather forecasts for the week were not great. Usually\nthe day would start out clear but rain or thundershowers would always come\nlater. This left us unwilling to hop on anything really big. The next day\n(Monday) was forecast to be clear until mid or late afternoon. We figured\nthat would give us enough time to knock off the classic First Pillar of\nTofana di Rozes. &quot;Klein aber fein,&quot; is the German expression for this route\n(small but nice): 14 pitches to grade V+ (about 5.8 on the Yosemite scale).\nThe year before I had climbed the ridge of the bigger Second Pillar, but\nthis was on the todo list for a long time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812776868/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4812776868_c27ed758f7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We got some take out pizza and watched the soccer final on tv. Jesse succeeded\nin pushing our start time back to 5 am. I, a picture of paranoia, wanted\nto get started an hour earlier. Without risk of spoiling the story, I can\nsay it worked out exactly perfect. We fell asleep before the overtime minutes\nwere done (ha!).</p>\n<p>The hike in the morning just took at hour. We had double ropes and a moderate\nsized rack with us. Jesse started up the rather dark and dubious looking\nfirst pitch. By the next pitch, amorphous features harded into a dihedral\nthat offered nice and sustained climbing. Pitch three was the supposed\ncrux at V+, and it was fairly stout. Jesse crabbed up to an overhang in\nthe dihedral and scooted around with some lieback and hand jamming moves.\nA raft of dubious pitons protected the moves, but I believe he got a good\n#2.5 Friend in somewhere in there. Two more unremarkable pitches got us\nto the crest, then exposed easy moves right on the crest led to a horizontal\ntraverse onto the east face. The views from this point became incredible,\nenhanced by sun and blue sky.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812778236/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4812778236_d9027fd7d4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812156571/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4812156571_979b9df65b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Some more traversing and moderate climbing on the east side of the ridge\ncrest got us to a rubble-strewn terrace. On the second pitch we had seen\na guide and a client come up and get started on the first pitch. Now we\nrealized they had definitely bailed. A few clouds were gathering.</p>\n<p>The next pitch was fairly exciting, being quite polished for some reason.\nI had to negotiate a kind of stalactite hanging down over the crack I followed.\nIt pushed me out into some lieback moves until I could squeeze back into\nthe now-wider crack...kind of a chimney at this point. I enjoyed that pitch!</p>\n<p>Some more pitches followed, though our attention was consumed by deteriorating\nweather. Jesse had an interesting pitch near the end when the clouds descended\nand the wind picked up. While he negotiated a short overhang with big holds\nand slabs above, I felt a few raindrops. He felt them too, and was in a\nhurry! Another long pitch got us to the end of the route, right below the\nsummit of the massive buttress. Happily, the weather improved again, with\nthe sun coming back out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812169603/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4812169603_4c487bbc42_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812796250/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4812796250_e4db7666a4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812798016/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4812798016_fb7bf1945d_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812800950/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4812800950_205014d87f_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>We enjoyed the walk down, admiring the ruins of an old hut and various\nwar ammo dumps and gun emplacements. It started to rain as we approached\nthe car, and suddenly let loose with a fury as we entered the Dibona Hut\nfor some lunch. We&#39;d timed everything perfectly! A big plate of spaghetti\nand some beer cheered us up. It was still early afternoon, and we were\nhappy to have made it down in time! The guide and his client spoke to us,\nI guess they bailed because of worries over the weather. Jesse had me in\nstitches because he noticed that the guide&#39;s van had a massive full color\nphoto of himself climbing photogenically on it...long hair wafting in the\nbreeze.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812181289/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4812181289_914b3cee6d_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/4812182729/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4812182729_2777759ebf_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p><em>I&#39;ve got more pictures in my Flickr gallery <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ripsawridge/sets/72157624544754412\">here</a>.</em></p>\n"}
